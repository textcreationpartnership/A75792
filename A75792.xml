         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Christian Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Congratulate that Title to thee; and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure my ſelf, that the more thou art <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,</hi> the more thou wilt be, Here, a <hi>Reader.</hi> For thou canſt not, then, be ſo great an enemy to thine own advancement in <hi>Piety,</hi> as to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the peruſal of this incomparable Piece, the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the <hi>Life</hi> of <hi>S. Auſtin;</hi> One of the greateſt <hi>Saints,</hi> and moſt profound <hi>Divines,</hi> that ever the <hi>Church</hi> of Chriſt enjoyed.</p>
            <p>This <hi>firſt or upper Part</hi> of it (repreſenting it as 'twere to the middle, even to the 33. year of his age) was drawn by his own Hand in theſe ten Books, conteining an humble <hi>Confeſsion</hi> to God; Firſt of the <hi>vanity and vitiouſneſs</hi> of his <hi>youth;</hi> then, of his <hi>miraculous Converſion;</hi> and, laſtly, of the remaining <hi>imperfections</hi> of his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate Condition:</hi> deploring the <hi>Evils,</hi> he had committed; and giving thanks for the <hi>good things,</hi> he had received.</p>
            <p>And it is here done into Engliſh, now, a third time; becauſe the Author was not ſatisfied, that in any of the former Tranſlations either the profundity of the ſence (peculiar to S. <hi>Auſtin</hi>)
<pb facs="tcp:120082:3"/>
was ſo exactly fathom'd, or the <hi>African</hi> elegan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of his ſtile ſo cleanly and pathetically deriv'd unto us. How much is here <hi>rectified,</hi> thou wilt beſt ſee, by <hi>comparing.</hi>

            <p>If I may perceive <hi>this</hi> acceptable to thee, I ſhall be encouraged to communicate ſhortly the <hi>other Part</hi> alſo; Relating the ſeveral acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents that befel him and his various employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from his return into <hi>Africk,</hi> where this ſtory ends, until his <hi>death:</hi> being that portion of his time, which, as it was the fulleſt of action; ſo was it the moſt eminent in <hi>devotion</hi> and <hi>ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity</hi> too, and therefore not paſſed to poſterity (as the former) under his <hi>own reflections;</hi> Yet I may ſay (in a manner ſtill) under his own hand though; becauſe thou ſhalt have it extracted, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of the faithful naration of his intimate domeſtick Friend, and <hi>ſecond-ſelf, Poſſidonius;</hi> or out of his own works; by one who hath ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly ſifted them, and thinks it a Religion, to ſhew thee any thing for S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> but S. <hi>Auſtin.</hi>

                     <p>An Account of his childhood, and his learning to speak.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>ANd thus growing on, and paſſing from Infancy, I came into my childhood, or rather it came into me, and here ſucceeded Infancy; nor did that mean-while depart, for whither went it? and yet it was now no more; for I was now no more a ſpeechleſſe babe, but a pratling child. And this I can remember, and have ſince obſerved, how I learned to ſpeak; which was, not * by being taught by art, as afterward I was forreign-language, by having the words ordered in a certain form and method of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but only * by the ſingle uſe of my memory, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural apprehenſion which thou my God gaveſt unto me: For, after I had firſt, by fits of crying, broken accents, and various motions of my ſkrewed limbs, attempted to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound my thoughts to thoſe that might aſſiſt my deſires, and yet was not able to explain my ſelf in all things which, and to whom I had a minde; I recorded it firſt in my yet unwritten memory, when I heard them name any, thing; and, when they moved their body toward the thing named, I obſerved it; and collected that, that which they pronounced, was that thing which they ſhewed. And that they meant this thing I was aſſured by certain motions of the parts of their body, the common and natural language (as it were) of all nations, uttered in the habit of the countenance, glances of the eye, poſtures of the members, accents of the voice, which paint and expreſſe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward paſſion of the ſoul, in her deſiring, fruition, hatred,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:120082:14"/>
or purſuance, of things: ſo grew I ſhortly acquainted with many words (whilſt they were in ſeveral ſentences placed in the ſame faſhion, and often again repeated) what particular things they did deſigne; and having by degrees tamed and broken my unacquainted mouth to a ſmooth, and ready articulation of them, by theſe notes I brought forth the long-ſuppreſſed conceptions of my ſoul. And, thus I began to enterchange theſe current ſignes of our conceits with the people amongſt whom I lived, and ſo launched ſtill farther out into the tempeſtuous ſociety of humane life, being as yet wholly dependent on my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents pleaſure, and the beck of my ſuperiours.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>O God, my God; what miſeries did I now encounter, and what impoſtures? When the way of right living, that was then propoſed to me a childe, was, to be obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to thoſe, who inſtructed me, how to become glorious in this world; and how to excell in thoſe verboſe Arts, which guide the way to humane honours, and falſe-named wealth. And ſo, I was put to ſchool, to get theſe Arts, and when, poor boy, I knew no profit of them, yet, was I mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably beaten, if I profited not in them: And this hard uſage was allowed of by my ſage ſuperiours; and many, that had trod that life afore us, had chalked out unto us theſe weariſome and craggy paths, through which we were conſtrained to follow them, with great pain and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row thus endleſſely multiplyed to the ſons of <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We little ones meanwhile obſerved, that men prayed unto thee; and we learnt of them to do the ſame; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving thee (as far as we could apprehend) to be ſome great one, who, not appearing to our ſenſes, couldſt, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, hear and relieve our neceſſities. I began therefore, when yet a childe, to pray unto thee (my aid and refuge) and then firſt inured my unſkill'd tongue to the invocating of thy holy name, and begged of thee (though a little one, with no little paſſion) that thou wouldeſt ſave me from whipping at School. And, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, thou didſt not hear me, in that which was inflicted on me for my good, but my elders alſo, and even my parents (far from wiſhing me any harm) made a jeſt of thoſe my ſtripes, my then grievous and remedileſs evil. Is there O Lord, amongſt thine, any ſo great a ſoul, and with ſo
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:120082:14"/>
ſtrong a paſſion adhering to thee? Is there any, I ſay, who becomes (not out of a ſenſeleſs ſtupidity, but) by an inſeparable union to thee, ſo tranſported in his minde, as that he can ſport at racks, and hooks, and a thouſand ſuch tortures (which all the world, with ſo much fear depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates of thee) laughing at thoſe, who tremble at theſe; in ſuch a manner, as our parents mocked at thoſe tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which we children then ſuffered from our ſevere Maſters? For, neither had we leſs horrour of theſe, than others of greater torments, nor importuned we thee leſs to eſcape them: Though meanwhile we were peccant in writing, or reading, or conning our leſſons, leſs, than was exacted of us.</p>
                  <p>Nor was this peccancy in us, O Lord, from want of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, or wit (ſuch as thou beſtoweſt on that age) but, from an importunate luſting which we had after play; and they revenged this fault in us, who committed much what the ſame themſelves. But our Superiors equall toyes are named buſineſs; and when boys-play is even the like, yet theſe are ſeourged for it by their overpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Maſter; and in this miſcarriage, of things, no body pitties the poor Children, or them, or both. For, who is he that, weighing things well, can juſtify my being beaten, when I was a boy, for playing at ball; when, by ſuch play, I was only hindred from a ſpeedier attaining thoſe vain arts, in which I ſhould play farr more unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemingly, when I was Flder. Nor did he, by whom I was corrected, meanwhile do any thing better himſelf; who, if worſted, in any mean criticiſme, by his fellow-teacher, was farr more racked with choler and envy, then I was with the ſame, when maſtered in a match at ball by my Companions.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>FOr I had heard ſomewhat, yet a childe, of life eternal, that was promiſed unto us by the humility of thy Son, our Lord God, deſcending hither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of our pride; and I was already ſigned with the ſigne of his Croſs, and was ſeaſoned with his<note n="†" place="margin">A custom in primitive times, to put ſalt into the mouthes of the <hi>Catechu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meni,</hi> intimating a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual pre-ſeaſoning of them for the reception of the grace of Baptiſme (ſee <hi>3.</hi> l.

Mark 9.49.</hi> in latter times this ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny was uſed to the newly baptized.</note> ſalt, even from my mothers womb, a woman, who put much hope in thee.</p>
                  <p>And thou ſaweſt, O Lord, I happening then to be pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at my ſtomack, and ſuddenly ſeized with a violent Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenture near unto death, thou ſaweſt O my God, (for even then waſt thou my Guardian) with what paſſion of minde, and with what faith, I importuned the piety of my own mother, and of our common mother, thy Church, for the Baptiſm of thy Chriſt, my Lord and God. And this much-perplexed mother of my fleſh (who now travailed far more dearly, in the womb of her chaſt heart, of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond birth of my eternal ſalvation, by her faith in thee, than before ſhe had done of my temporal) was taking
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:120082:15"/>
care, that, with all ſpeed, I ſhould be initiated and purged with the ſalutary<note n="†" place="margin">Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, as well as Baptiſm, in thoſe dayes gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Infants.</note> Sacraments, confeſſing thee, O Lord Jeſus, for remiſſion of ſins; But that I had a ſuddain reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; upon which, this my cleanſing was, for that time, deferred; although it could not be avoided, but that, if I lived longer, I ſhould be yet more defiled, and ſo the guilt contracted from the renewed pollutions of ſins, after that holy lavatory, would have become greater far, and far more dangerous.</p>
                  <p>Thus, then, I believed in thee, and ſhe, and the whole family excepting my Father, who yet could not overſway in me the juſt power of my mothers piety, to make me not believe in Chriſt, as he at that time believed not in him. For, it was her holy endeavour, that thou, my God, ſhouldeſt be my Father, more than He: and thou aſſiſtedſt her herein to overcome her huſband. To whom, in other things, ſhe, though much better, yielded all obedience; becauſe ſhe was to yield all obedience to thee, and this obedience to her huſband was commanded by thee.<note n="†" place="margin">Men ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized in their ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs were by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited ſacred Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cauſe their Baptiſme ſeemed ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsitated.</note> For what reaſon, O my God, I would fain know, was this my Baptiſm at that time delayed? and whether for any my greater good, were the reins of my ſinning longer left looſe upon me? For if they were not then left looſe, whence is it that on every ſide we do ſtill hear it ſaid of ſuch and ſuch: <hi>Let him alone, let him do what he will, for he is not yet baptized?</hi> and yet, concerning corporal ſanity, we ſay not, Let him yet receive more wounds, for he is not yet cured of the former? How much better had it been for me, to have been ſo early healed! and that, with my own, and my friends ſtrict care, the health of my ſoul, thus reſtored, might have been ever after kept entire, by thy preſerving what thou hadſt reſtored? This, ſurely, had been much the better. But that my good Mother, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready foreſeeing, how many, and how great, billows of temptations, after my childhood ſpent, were ready to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault, and to ore-ſet my more unbridled youth, choſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to expoſe to their blows, me now before baptiſm, as yet a lump of rude clay, which, by it, afterward might be new moulded, than me, when by the Sacraments, thy new-formed image, which ſo perchance might happen to be defaced.</p>

                  <p>BUt why at that time I ſhould ſo much hate Greek, I do not yet well underſtand; for Latine I liked very well, I mean not, that which our firſt Maſters ſpell unto us, but that which the Grammarians teach; for that firſt learning, to Read, and Write, and caſt up an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, I thought as afflicting and vexatious as the Greek?

                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 78.39.</note> For that firſt learning was for the better, becauſe truer, and more certain (which enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me with a faculty neceſſary, and as eaſily retained, whereby I both read now what I finde written, and write, my ſelf, what I have a minde) than this other, in which
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:120082:16"/>
I learnt, and was enjoyned, to remember, the errors and wandrings of, I know not what, <hi>Aeneas,</hi> forgetful of my own errors; and ſhed tears for the death of one <hi>Dido,</hi> who killed herſelf for love, when meanwhile I beheld my ſelf, in theſe amorous toyes, periſhing from thee (O God my life) with dry eyes: miſerable, Creature, as I then was; for what is more miſerable than one that is in miſery, and yet hath no commiſeration of himſelf? ſadly bewailing wanton <hi>Dido's</hi> death, cauſed by exceſſe of love to <hi>Aeneas,</hi> and never deploring his own death, cauſed by want of love to thee?</p>
                  <p>O God the glorious light of my heart, and delicate food of the inner mouth of my ſoul, and celeſtiall power, that now eſpouſeth my mind, poſſeſſing the boſome of my thoughts, I did not then love thee, and went a whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from thee, and to this my fornication it was ecchoed on every ſide, <hi>Euge, Euge,</hi> well-done, well-done, for the <hi>friendſhip of this world is fornication againſt thee.</hi>

                  <p>I therefore when a boy did ſin, in preferring, in my fond affection, theſe empty things before thoſe uſeful; or rather in hating the one, whilſt I doted on the other.

For the hardneſs of attaining a forreign-tongue did, as it were, oreſprinkle with gall all the ſweets of ſuch fabulous ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.

For, I diſcerned not that gulf of filthineſſe, wherein I then lay, caſt out of the ſight of thine eyes; for to thoſe holy pure eyes what could appear more loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome than I, who became ſo diſpleaſing alſo to others; whilſt, with innumerable lyes, I deceived both my School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters and Parents, out of love to play; deſire to ſee, and inquietude to imitate, toyes.</p>

Which ſeemed to me but womaniſh advice, and which men ſhould be aſhamed to obey: and it was thine; and I knew it not, ſuppoſing thee to be ſilent, and her to ſpeak it, who, by her, waſt not ſilent unto me; and, in her, waſt alſo deſpiſed by me; by me, her ſon, <hi>the ſon of thine handmaid,</hi>

                  <p>What is there reproachful, but only vice?

Behold, with what companions I travelled in thoſe ſtreets of <hi>Babilon;</hi> &amp; wallowed in the mire thereof, as in a bed of ſpices and precious odours; while the inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble enemy trampled upon me, and ſeduced me, becauſe I my ſelf was prone alſo to be ſo ſeduced.

                     <p>Of his Theft, * done only out of wantonneſſe.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THeft is a thing that is puniſhed by thy law (O Lord) and alſo by the law written in the hearts of men; which law wickedneſſe it ſelf never utterly cancels in us: for, what thief doth eaſily endure a thief? or, who, in plenty, endureth another ſtealing for neceſſity? Yet I alſo, luſted to ſteal, and executed it, not forced thereto by want or need; but out of a loathing of honeſty, and longing to ſin. For I ſtole that, of which I had, my ſelf, great plenty, and much better; neither delighted I in the fruition of the thing ſtollen, but only in the ſin of the theft.</p>
                  <p>Near a vineyard of ours, there was a tree well-loaden with apples, not much tempting either ſight or taſt: a company of wicked boyes of us went late at night to rob it; having till then (according to a looſe cuſtome) drawn out our ſports in the ſtreets: And thence we carried great loads, not for our own eating, but even to be caſt to the hogs, after we had firſt only-taſted them, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted our ſelves in the doing of, what we pleaſed, not what we ought.</p>
                  <p>Lo: my heart (O my God) lo, my heart (whereof thou hadſt pity, in the bottom of this hell) let it now tell thee, what it was, that it then affected? Even, that I might be wicked <hi>gratis,</hi> and have no provocation to ill, but the evil it ſelf. I was enamoured of this, I on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loved to periſh; I loved to be faulty; not that thing in the which I was faulty, but the very faultineſſe I loved. Unclean and filthy ſoul, ſtarting from thy ſtable firmament, toward all extreams; not, by diſgrace, proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting ſomething elſe, but only the diſgrace.</p>

                     <p>—And * void of excuſe; when—as moſt ſins pretend ſome good to the ſinner.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THere is a tempting appearance in all fair and glittering bodies, in gold, and in ſilver, and the reſt: alſo in carnal touches, there is a ſympathy that tranſports us; and in the reſt of our ſences, there is a contemperature of other bodies exactly tuned to the complacency of each of them. Even temporal honour, and the power of conquering, and maſtery, hath its ſplendor and ornament, whence ſprings ſo ſtrong an appetite of revenge (yet therefore may not we, for gain of theſe, O Lord, depart from thee, nor turn aſide from thy law). The mortal life alſo, which we live here, hath its blandiſhments, from a certain kinde of ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry, and proportion that it hath to all the reſt of theſe lower beauties. And, in it, the friendſhip alſo of men is, in a raviſhing manner, ſweet from a combined union of many hearts.</p>
                  <p>And, upon occaſion of all theſe, and the like, much ſin is committed: whilſt, by an immoderate propenſion to theſe, the laſt of goods, thoſe beſt and higheſt are deſerted, even Thou, O Lord our God, and thy truth, and thy law. For theſe things below have alſo their delights, but not like my God,<note place="margin">Pſal. 32.1.</note> by whom all they were made, <hi>becauſe in him doth the righteous delight, and he is the joy of the upright in heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore, when we queſtion, for what cauſe any crime is done; tis preſumed to proceed, either from a deſire of acquiring, or a fear of loſing, ſome of theſe the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of goods: becauſe they alſo are ſome way lovely and pretty, though in compariſon of thoſe ſuperiour treaſures, and beatifical riches, contemptible and baſe.</p>
                  <p>One man hath murdered another; what moved him to it? he loved his wife, or his land, or would rob him for his own livelihood, or from the other feared ſome ſuch loſſe; or, firſt inſured, thirſted for revenge.

                  <p>BUt, O my Theft, that wicked night-exploit of my <hi>ſixteen</hi> years age, what was it then, that wretched I ſo much loved in thee? For nothing fair thou wert, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou wert Theft, or indeed, wert thou at all any thing, that thus I ſpeak unto thee? Indeed the fruit we robbed was fair, becauſe it was thy Creature, thou fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of all, Creator of all, my good God, God my true and my ſupream good; fair was the fruit, but that was not it, after which my miſerable ſoul luſted, having thereof far better, in great plenty, of our own. But the other rather I liked, becauſe ſo I might ſteal it; which being once gathered, as having now ſufficiently ſatisfied my appetite, I threw it away; enjoying there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of only the pleaſure of the ſin: or if I chanced to taſt any of the fruit, that, which ſweetned it unto me, was the offence.</p>
                  <p>And now, O Lord my God, fain would I know, what it was, in this fault, that ſo much delighted me: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I cannot find the leaſt allurance of any beauty in it. I do not mean ſuch beauty as is ſeen in the divine ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits of Juſtice and Prudence; or, as in the higheſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of underſtanding and memory; or, as in the ſubtility of the ſenſes; or yet in the vigours of Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: nor yet (inferiour to theſe) as the ſtars are glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and orderly in their Orbs; or, as the Earth and Sea are beautifull in their kind; being alwayes laden with breed; a new growth of which, in their unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted womb, ſtill ſucceeds a former departed. But <hi>I</hi> mean ſuch a gloſs at leaſt, as there is (a faint and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted one) in many a deluding vice. For, both * the ſin of pride (to be ſome way like unto thee) emulates high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, when as thou art only, above all, the moſt high God. And * Ambition aims at glory and honour; when as thou alone art honourable ſupreamly, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally glorious. And * the cruelty of the great ones deſires ſo to become reverenced and feared; and <hi>who is to be feared, but God alone?</hi> from whoſe power what,<note place="margin">Pſal. 76.7.</note> or
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:120082:24"/>
when, or where, or how, or by whom, can ever any thing, by force or fraud, be ſubducted? And * the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes of the laſcivious ſeek to be loved: when as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is any thing ſo dearly ſweet as thy <hi>Love,</hi> nor ſo ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly enamouring, as thy above-all-beautifull and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning <hi>Truth.</hi> And * Curioſity makes ſemblance of a deſire of knowledge, when, as it is Thou, that perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtandeſt all things. Alſo, even * ignorance and folly, clothes it ſelf with the name of ſimplicity and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency; becauſe not any thing is found like ſimple as thy ſelf, and what is there innocent like thee, whoſe works are harmfull only to the ſinner. And * ſloth affects, as it were, quiet; but what repoſe certain, beſides the Lord? * Luxury deſires to be called ſatiety and plenty, yet thou art the only fulneſs, and never-failing abundance of uncorrupting dainties. * Laviſhing hides it ſelf under the ſhadow of liberality; but the moſt royally overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing doner of all good things is thy ſelf. * Avarice would have much to be in its fruition; and it is Thou that poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſeſt all things. * Envy contends for pre-eminence; and what is ſo pre-excellent, as thy ſelf?* Anger pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends juſt vengeance; and who executes it righteouſly like thee? * Fear abhorrs things, unuſuall, ſurprizing, and Enemies to what ſhe loves; whilſt ſhe is alwayes precautelous of her ſafety; now to thee only it is, that nothing comes unacquainted or ſudden; and who can part what thou loveſt from thee? and where, but with thee, ever dwells unſhaken ſecurity? * Sorrow pines for thoſe things loſt, in whoſe enjoyment ſhe delighted, becauſe ſhe deſires, that nothing may be taken away from her; as nothing can, from thee. After theſe the ſoul goes a whoring, when ſhe is departed from thee; and ſeeks, beſides thee, what ſhe never finds pure and clear, but when returned unto thee. And yet all they (in a wrong way) imitate, and ſeek likeneſs unto, thee, who render themſelves far from thee, and who pride them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves moſt againſt thee. And, in this their imitating and reſembling thee, ſhew thee to be the Creator of all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and that, in it, they cannot any-whither recede from thee. What therefore in that Theft was it, that I loved? and in what here (though viciouſly and perverſly) have I alſo imitated my Lord?

                     <p>Of Stage-playes much affected by him, and, of the faulty paſſions they cauſed in him.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>ABout this time alſo I was mainly carried away with Stage-playes and interludes, which were repleniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with * the images of my own miſeries, and * the fewel of my fires. And here what means it, that a man deſires to grieve in beholding theſe mournful and tragical ſights, which things himſelf would by no means ſuffer? and yet from them he ſuffers ſorrow, when a ſpectator; and this ſorrow is his delight. What means this, but a wretched madneſſe in men? For ſo much more is any affected by them, by how much himſelf is leſſe free from the like paſſions. Though when himſelf ſuffers ſuch things, 'tis miſery; when he compaſſionates others, 'tis ſtiled Pity. But what kind of pity that, in theſe (only feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſcenical) diſaſters? For there the Auditor is not ſolicited to ſuccour, but invited to deplore; and he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauds the Actors of thoſe repreſentations the more, the more they make him grieve. And if perhaps the calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of ſuch perſons, whether hiſtorical, or feigned, be ſo coldly acted, as not to contriſtate the ſpectator, be ſpeedily departs full of anger and diſdain; but, if it be otherwiſe, ſtayes attentive, and ſheds joyful tears. Love we ſorrows then, and tears? Surely every one deſires joy rather. Or, is it, that, when as we deſire, that
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:120082:26"/>
none ſhould be miſerable, yet we are pleaſed, that our ſelves ſhould be pitiful, and this pity not being at all without ſome grief, therfore becomes grief it ſelf alſo affected? And all this proceeds from a certain vein and ſource of friendſhip in us.</p>
                  <p>But whither goes that ſource? Whither runs it? Wherefore falls it at length into that torrent of boyling pitch, thoſe vaſt whirlpools of ſtinking luſts, into which it becomes wilfully changed and transformed, being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitated and degraded from its own celeſtial purity? Muſt all affection and pity then be abandoned? by no means; and hence ſometimes grief alſo may be loved. But beware of any uncleaneſs in theſe, O my ſoul, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the tuition of my God, the God of our Fathers, and through all ages to be praiſed and ſuperexalted, beware of any uncleaneſſe in them. For now alſo am I not void of compaſſion and pity: But whereas then in thoſe thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters I co-rejoyced with lovers, when enjoying their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſt deſires (though theſe imaginary only, in the play) and, out of pity to them, grew as ſad, when they loſt one another; and yet both theſe paſſions afforded me delight; I now (contrary) more pity one, when triumphing in his obtained wickedneſſe, than when deſpairing in the miſſing of that pernicious pleaſure, and in the loſs of that miſerable felicity.</p>
                  <p>This certainly is the truer compaſſion: but in it the heart is not joyed. For though he is commended for doing an office of charity, that condoles anothers miſery; yet had he alwaies rather, that thing had not been, which he condoles, whoſoever is truly compaſſionate. For if good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will could be thus ill-wiſhing (which cannot be) then he, that truly and ſincerely pities, might deſire another ſhould be miſerable, to the end that himſelf ſo might be merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Some grief then is to be approved, none to be lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (yet is it ſometimes too approved: for this belongs to thee only, Lord God, that whilſt thou loveſt ſouls farr more purely then we, and more incorruptibly haſt pity toward them, yet no manner of ſorrow for them can wound thee. <hi>And who is ſufficient for ſuch things beſides thee?)</hi> But I then poor wretch Loved to grieve; and ſearched what might cauſe it; when, in another mans, and this only a perſonated, diſaſter, that action of the player delighted more, and ſtronglier bewitched me, that drew tears from me. And what marvel was it, that I an unfortunate ſheep, ſtrayed from thy flock, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:120082:27"/>
of thy diſcipline, ſhould be overſpread with ſuch a naſty ſcab? And hence was that affection to ſorrow, not ſuch, as pierced me inwardly (for neither did I love to ſuffer, what I loved to ſee); but ſuch, as, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated only, and feigned, but razed as it were the skin of my ſoul, yet, like the ſcratching of an envenomed nail, an enflamed tumor and impoſtumation and putrefaction followed upon it. Such was the life I led: But indeed was that then to be called a life, O my God.</p>

                  <p>Thoſe ſtudies, which were counted of great repute, had a ſtrong influence upon me (as, fitting us for plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the publick Courts of Juſtice) and I, had an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition to be excellent in them; thus to become ſo much the famouſer, how much by my eloquence more deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: ſo great is the blindneſs of Men, glorying alſo in their blindneſs.

                     <p>In the nineteenth year of his age, his reading of Cicero's Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſius invites him, from affectation of Eloquence, to the ſearch of Wiſdom.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>AMongſt this company (then a youth) I learned books of Eloquence; in which I deſired to be eminent; but out of a faulty and ambitious end, and a fond affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of humane vanities; and, in the uſual courſe of ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, I then was to read a certain book of one <hi>Cicero,</hi> whoſe tongue almoſt all Men admire, not ſo his heart. Which Treatiſe of his conteined an exhortation to Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, called <hi>Hortenſius:</hi> And this book it was, that firſt altered my affections, and turned my addreſſes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, (O Lord) and rendred my purpoſes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires clean of another mould, than formerly.

Now, not to ſharpen my tongue (which thing I came thither to purchaſe with the exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition my Mother then allowed me, I being now <hi>nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen</hi> years old, and my Father deceaſed <hi>two</hi> years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) no more now <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Now how did I burn, O my God, how did I burn to re-mount up from things terrene toward thee (not then knowing, what thou wouldſt act with me)? For with thee only is wiſdom; and the love of wiſdom (cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Philoſophy) was it, with which thoſe writings ſo enflamed me. <hi>There are thoſe that ſeduce through Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy;</hi> with this ſmooth and noble and vertuous name pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liating

And, in this great ardency of mine, this one thing only cooled me, that the name of Chriſt was not there. Becauſe this name, according to thy mercy, O Lord, this name of my Saviour thy Son, my tender heart, with my very Mothers milk, had piouſly imbibed, and deeply apprehended; and whatſoever wanted this name, though never ſo learned, polite, or veritable, yet did not wholly ſway me.</p>

Even ſuch are they, who ſtrange at it, when they hear; that righteous men in one age might do ſomething, which in another, righteous men might not; and that God had commanded one thing to theſe, to thoſe another, for reaſons temporal, whilſt ſtill the ſame eternal juſtice is obeyed by both: when as yet in one man, and on one day, and in one family, they ſee ſeveral things ſute to the ſeveral members; ſomething formerly lawful, after an hour not ſo: ſome thing in one corner permitted, or alſo commanded, that is in another forbidden &amp; puniſhed. Doth the rule of juſtice then ſwerve ſometimes and vary from it ſelf? No. But the times, over which it preſides, run not conſtant, and even, for they are (fleeting) times.

                  <p>There was at that time a ſharp-witted man, very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert in the Art of Phyſick, and one of the nobleſt of that profeſſion; who, being then Proconſul, with his own hand ſet the Agoniſtical Garland upon my ſick head; but not as its Phyſician.

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:120082:35"/>
and not idly to beſtow my care and pains, uſeful for more neceſſary ſtudies, upon thoſe fruitleſs vanities. Telling me, that himſelf in his yonger years had ſo ſtudied them, that he intended wholly to have owed his maintenance to that profeſsion; &amp; that he, who well underſtood <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> ſurely was not uncapable of that kind of learning; yet that afterward, quitting it, he had betaken himſelf to Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, only out of a diſcovery of the falſity thereof; and ſo, an unwillingneſs to ſuſtain himſelf by deceits and cheating: But you, ſaid he, have the profeſsion of Rhetorick, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to ſubſiſt; and do purſue this fallacious ſtudy, not out of neceſſity, but choice; by how much the more you ought in this point to give me credit; who endeavoured to attain perfection in it, with deſign to get my living by it.</p>

For if out of a page of a poet dipt-into at hap-hazard, a verſe often appears ſtrangly conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to our preſent buſineſs; whereas the poets device and intention was farr different, 'tis leſs to be admired (ſaid he) if out of the ſoul of a man, from a ſuperior inſtinct (it ſelf being nothing conſcious thereof) by hap, not art, ſomething is delivered which cloſely ſutes to the condition and affairs of the enquirer.—And ſo much that man, or thou by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumency, conveyedſt unto me; and regiſtredſt in my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory what I ſhould afterward by my ſelf further examine.

And I preſently, as ſoon as I could ſpeak with him (which was ſo ſoon as he could anſwer me, for I departed not from him, who too intimately depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on each other) began to ſcoff to him, as to one like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that would deride with me, the baptiſm, which he had received, when he was ſo much abſented, at that inſtant, both in underſtanding and ſenſes; though he had been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted after, that he had received it. But he looked upon me with the ſame horror, as it had been on an enemy; and, with a wonderful, and ſuddenly-aſſumed, freedom, adviſed me, that if I meant to continue a friend, I ſhould deſiſt to ſpeak to him on that manner. And I, though perplexed and amazed thereat, yet deferred my paſſion till his recovery; and till the ſtrength of his health were capable of my agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with him what I thought fit. But he, raviſhed from my

                  <p>BUt why do I ſpeak of theſe things? For this is not a time now of queſtioning, but of confeſſing unto thee. Miſerable then I was, and miſerable is every ſoul fettered with the love of mortal things; and racked aſunder it is, when it loſeth them: and then reſents the infelicity, by which it was equally miſerable, before it loſt them. So was I at that time, and mourned moſt bitterly; and in that bitterneſs placed my repoſe. Such a wretch I was, and I accounted dearer to me even than that my Friend, this my ſo wretched life. For although fain I would have changed it, yet was I unwilling to have loſt it, any more than him, and I know not whether unwilling to have loſt it, even for him. As 'tis ſtoried of <hi>Oreſtes</hi> and <hi>Pylades</hi> (if it be not a fiction) that they ſtrove to dye * for each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; or, at leaſt, * together; to whom not to live to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, was a thing worſe than death. But there ruled in me, I know not what, paſſion, quite contrary to this: Both the tediouſneſs of living was moſt afflicting to me, and the fear of death. I think becauſe the more I loved him, the more I abhorred and dreaded (that my cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt Enemy) Death, that bereaved me of him; fancying it a monſter, that would ſoon devour the reſt of men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it could deſtroy him. Even thus, I well remember, ſtood I then affected.</p>
                  <p>(Behold my heart O my God; Behold and ſee into me, how I remember this very well, O thou my hope, that now cleanſeſt me from the impurity of ſuch paſſions; guiding my eyes unto thy beauties, and plucking my feet out of theſe ſnares.)

For I carried about a ſoul all lacerated and gored in blood; and impatient longer to be carried by me; and where, to repoſe it I found not. Not in delightſome groves, nor in playes and muſick, not in fragant odors, nor in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſit banquets, not in the pleaſures of the chamber, or of the bed, not in books or poeſie took it any reſt.

For ſo I then loved men, according to the eſtimation of men; and not thine, O my God, Which is never deceived. <q>[But yet why loved I him, not as I did ſome others (a famous Chariotier, or Huntſman, &amp;c.) that are much extolled by popular applauſe, but with a farr different and more ſerious affection, and ſo, as my ſelf alſo deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the ſame commendation.</q>

                     <p>S. <hi>Auſtins</hi> affection to the Manichean Doctrines much abated upon diſcovery of <hi>Fauſtus</hi> his ignorance; whom he inſtructs in the Art of Rhetorick.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>WHen therefore he alſo, (after much tryal made of him) appeared ſufficiently ignorant of thoſe arts, in which I preſumed him excellent, I deſpaired of receiving from him any ſolution of thoſe doubts, which ſo much perplexed me. Though yet, in the ignorance of thoſe arts, I grant he might have retained ſtill the truths of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſuppoſing he had not been a Manichean. For their books are full of tedious fables, of the Heaven, and the Starrs, and the Sun, and the Moon, which now I had no longer a conceit that he could evidence unto me, by ſhewing out of the Manichean writings, reaſons better, or at leaſt equal to thoſe I had formerly read. Which reaſons when I propoſed to be examined, and diſcuſſed, he (modeſtly) durſt not undertake the controverſy; and, well knowing his ignorance, neither was he aſhamed to acknowledg it: not like to thoſe I before met with, who undertook to teach me, and ſaid nothing. But he had a ſoul, though not upright towards thee, yet not alſo treacherous to himſelf: not altogether ignorant was he of his ignorance; and not willing in a raſh diſpute, to run himſelf into thoſe ſtraits, out of which he could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther find an iſſue, nor a fair retreat. And herein his carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age much took me; the modeſty of his ſoul, in confeſsing

its defects, having much more beauty and worth in it, then his ſcience could have had, in ſolving my doubts. And in all difficulter and ſubtler queſtions which I propoſed, on this manner I found him.</p>
                  <p>My affection therefore which I formerly had to the Manichean opinions was now much abated, and deſpairing of their other Doctors ſkill, after the trial of one ſo much famed, I began a new converſation with him in thoſe ſtudies of Rhetorick, which he much affected, and I then taught at <hi>Carthage;</hi> reading with him ſuch books as he deſired, or I thought ſutable for ſuch a wit, and to ſuch a purpoſe. But all deſign of further advancing my ſelf in that Sect, after his acquaintance, now fell to the ground; only I continued to be what by chance I then was, untill I ſhould diſcover ſomething more eligible.</p>
                  <p>Thus this <hi>Fauſtus,</hi> to ſo many the fetters of death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the firſt looſer of my chaines, and that neither wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, nor willing it, himſelf.

Therefore, thoſe wicked faſhions, which I hated my ſelf to do, when I was a ſtudent, being now forced to ſuffer, when a Maſter, from others, I reſolv'd rather to remove to a place,<note place="margin">Pſ. 142.5.</note> where I was told were no ſuch inſolencies.

                  <p>FOr when as I minded not to learn, what he ſaid, but only how he ſaid it (for this vain care now only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in me, deſpairing of any further guidance there to the knowing of thee) there deſcended into my ſoul with the language which I affected, the matter alſo which I ſlighted; not poſſible to be ſevered by me; and whilſt I opened my heart to entertain the eloquence of his ſayings, together with it entered in the truth of them: Yet this by ſlow and gentle degrees. For firſt there ſeemed to me, that ſome plea might be made for the Catholick faith: and that, for which I formerly ſuppoſed nothing (ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall) againſt the Manichees objections could be ſaid, I thought now capable of ſome modeſt defence. Eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, after I had heard, one, or two, or more <hi>Enigma's,</hi> and obſcure places of the old Teſtament, well reſolv'd and cleared; which whilſt before I underſtood literally, by them I was ſlain ſpiritually.</p>
                  <p>Very many places of thoſe books being thus explained; then I began to blame my deſpair; yet thus farr only; that I ſhould think impoſſible any probable reply, to thoſe who oppoſed and derided the law and the prophets. Yet neither did I therefore ſee reaſon, that the Catholick way ſhould be taken, becauſe it had alſo ſuch patrons and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bettors, as were able, without abſurdity, to repell ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections; nor yet, that what I held on the contrary ſhould be condemned, becauſe both were defenſible. For the Catholick cauſe ſeemed to me to be ſo not conquered, as alſo not to have obtained the victory. And now I began more couragiouſly to conſider, if by any means I might, upon any certain grounds, convince the Manichees of falſhood. And could I but once have imagined a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ſpirituall, I had quickly demoliſhed and caſt away all their ſtructures out of my ſoul; but ſuch a ſubſtance I could not fancy.</p>
                  <p>Yet, concerning, the corporeall ſubſtance of this ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary World, and all the pieces of nature occurring to ſenſe, I, (more and more conſidering and comparing things) judged the Philoſopher to have much better dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiz'd,

than the Manichee. Therefore like the Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micks (as they are reported) doubting of all things and fluctuating between all ſides, yet I reſolved preſently to abandon the Manichean profeſſion; enduring no more (though in this ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Yet neither could Philoſophy ſatisfie Men, nor durſt I commit the cure of my ſick and languiſhing ſoul, to an order void of the ſaving name of Chriſt; and therefore I reſolved to continue a Catechumenus in the Church Catholick, (which religion remained from both my Parents recommended unto me) till ſome thing of certainty ſhould appear, to which I might ſteer my courſe.</p>

                  <p>HE, purſuing the ſecular courſe of life which was preſſed upon him by his parents, was gone to <hi>Rome</hi> before me, to ſtudy the laws there. And, (there) was again carried away to the Gladiatory ſhews, with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible paſſion, and after as incredible a manner. For, he being much averſe from, and deteſting, ſuch ſports, ſome friends and fellow-ſtudents, meeting him in the ſtreets after dinner, with a familiar violence, would needs hurry him along with them (though making much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance and many excuſes) to the Amphitheater, upon a day when thoſe cruel and mortall ſports were there ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited. He ſaying to them: If ye do hale my body thither, and fixe it there, yet can ye force me to lend my mind or my eyes at leaſt to ſuch a loathed ſpectacle? Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in my corporall preſence there I will be abſent, and ſo triumph or'e both you, and it.</p>
                  <p>They, hearing this, notwithſtanding had him along, perhaps to try whether he had power to do, as he ſaid: whither ſo ſoon as they came, and had gotten places, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently theſe horrid ſports began.</p>

For, upon a certain accident in the fight, a great ſhout be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing raiſed by the people, he, out of curioſity, and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, whatever it might be, though ſeeing, to deſpiſe, it, opened his eyes; and hence was preſently ſtruck with a greater wound in his ſoul, than the Gladiator, (beheld by him) was in his body; and fell himſelf farre more miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably, than he at whoſe fall this clamour was made; which entred through his eares, and unlocked his eyes, through which a mortal blow was given to his ſoul, yet more confident, than confirm'd; and for this alſo the weaker, that it preſumed to have from it ſelf, what it could owe to thee alone. For no ſooner had he ſeen that ſtream of blood, but he alſo drunk down the cruelty and ſavage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thereof, with eyes no more averted, but fixed upon it: and he ſucked in thoſe furies, and knew not, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came delighted with the crime of the combat, and inebri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated with thoſe bloody pleaſures. And no more was he the man he came, but now one of the multitude amongſt whom he ſate, and their true Aſſociate, with whom he came. What ſhall I more ſay? He beheld, he ſhouted, he grew hot upon the ſport, he carried away a longing mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to return, not only with his former ſeducers, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, and without them, and ſeducing others. And yet from hence alſo, with a moſt ſtrong and merciful hand, thou ſavedſt him; and by this alſo learnedſt him, that he could have nothing from himſelf, but all from thee.

any upon a ſlight credulity. For as he was then walking alone, with his table-book and ſtile in his hand, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Tribunal, another of the Schollars, a true Thief, carrying ſecretly a hatchet, undiſcovered by him, had got into the leads, that covered the Silver-ſmiths ſhops, and there fell on cutting them.

And <hi>Alipius,</hi> who ſaw him, though not at his going in, yet coming forth, and making ſuch haſt away, deſirous to know the cauſe, went into the place, and taking up the hatchet, ſtood wondring, what he had been doing with it; when they that were ſent come in, and find him with the hatchet in his hand: they lay hold on him, draw him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, and, calling the Shop-keepers of the <hi>Forum</hi> together, rejoice, as if they had taken the true Thief in the very act; and ſo he was to be carried before the Judge. And thus far thy Servant was to be inſtructed. But thou (O Lord) preſently relievedſt that his innocency, of which thou waſt a ſole witneſs. For as he was led, either to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or to puniſhment, there met him the Architect, that had the chief overſight of thoſe publick buildings; And glad the Officers were that they met him, eſpecially (who was apt to ſuſpect ſome of them for the thefts done there) that he might now at length ſee, who had done all thoſe robberies. But ſo it happened, that this man had often ſeen <hi>Alipius</hi> in a Senatours houſe, which he fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented: and, knowing him, took him by the hand aſide, and was informed by him, how all things had paſſed: and ſo intreating the people, who made a great tumult, and uſed many threats, to go along with him, he came to the houſe of the young man who had done the fact, where, ſtood at the door the Gentlemans boy, who had attended on him in the <hi>Forum,</hi> ſo little a one, as that he might tell all the matter, without having ſuſpicion therefrom of any hurt to his Maſter. <hi>Alipius,</hi> knowing him again, ſtreight intimated ſo much to the Artificer, and he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> preſently ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the hatchet to the boy, asked if he knew whoſe it might be? who quickly anſwered, tis our hatchet; then, further examined, told all the reſt.

                  <p>AND I wondered extremely, when I conſidered what a long time it was ſince the nineteenth year of my age; when I began firſt to be enflamed with the purſuite of Wiſdom; reſolving, upon diſcovery thereof, to quit all other empty hopes, and deceiving frenzies of vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:120082:59"/>
deſires: and now behold me thirty years old, ſtill ſticking in the ſame mire, covetous after the fruition of things, * preſent, * drawing me hither and thither, and * then flying from me; whilſt I ſaid to my ſelf; To mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row I ſhall find it out; it will clearly diſcover it ſelf, and I ſhall embrace it: and; Behold, <hi>Fauſtus</hi> will come, and will expound all to me. O wiſe Academicks (then ſaid I) in whoſe opinion, there is nothing certainly knowable for the regulating of humane life Nay; (ſaid I then) But let us not deſpair, but more diligently ſearch on: Behold there are not thoſe abſurdities in the Eccleſiaſtical Books that we imagined, but they may be otherwiſe, and ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, interpreted. Finally, let me remain in thoſe noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Religion, wherein my childhood was inſtructed by my parents, till clear truth be found out. But where, or when, ſhall we ſeek it? <hi>Ambroſe</hi> is not at leiſure; nor have we the leiſure to read books. Where ſhall we ſeek theſe books? with what, or, in what time, procure them? upon whoſe recommendations take them?—Nay; but let us ſet ſome times apart; let us contribute ſome certain houres for the ſalvation of our ſoul: Great hope appears; the Church Catholick teacheth not, what we thought, and whereof vainly we accuſed her. Her learned condemn it as blaſphemous, to think God terminated with an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſhape, and doubt we to knock, that the reſt may be opened? My Schollars employ my forenoon houres; for the reſt of my time what do I; why not do this? But when then viſit our greater friends, whoſe favours we muſt uſe? when prepare the matter we ſell to our Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars? and when repair our ſpirits, in relaxing our mind from this intention of cares?— Periſh all; and let theſe vain and empty ſolicitudes be diſmiſſed; and let us now ſet our ſelves only to this inquiſition of truth. The life we live is wretched; death uncertain; if it ſhould ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ſeize on us, in what a caſe go we hence? and where ever ſhall we learn, what here neglect? or more; ſhall not this our neglect, then, be puniſhed? But yet, what if death deprive the ſoul of all its ſenſe, and its cares, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether? Then is this alſo worthy to be ſought out. But God forbid, it ſhould be ſo. Sure, 'tis no vain, no empty matter, that the authority of the Chriſtian faith ſhould thus o're ſpread all the world with ſo great pre-eminence and renown; and, ſurely, the divine hand would not have operated ſo great things for us, if, together with the death of the body, were alſo waſted and extinguiſh'd the life of
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:120082:60"/>
the ſoul?? Why delay we then, the hopes of the preſent age forſaken, to give up our ſelves wholly to the ſearch of God and happineſs.</p>
                  <p>But deferre a while: theſe things are alſo pleaſant, and have in them no little ſweetneſs. Let us not call off our intentions from them too haſtily, becauſe, after this done, it will be diſhonourable to return to them; ſee how little we want of acquiring ſome place of honour in the world, and this obtained, we may then ſet up our reſt. Great ſtore of friends we have, very potent; if nothing elſe be got, and our haſt will not ſtay for a better place, yet we may ſoon attain a Preſidentſhip: And then a Wife alſo muſt be gotten with a reaſonable dowry, that ſhe may not be a charge. And here ſhall my ſecular deſires take up. Many great and imitable perſons have beſtowed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the ſtudy of wiſdom, being married.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt I diſcourſed ſuch things, and theſe contrary winds drove my heart to and fro, the times ran on; and I foreſlowed to be converted to the Lord God; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred from day to day to live in thee, though I deferred not daily, more and more to die, in my ſelf. In love with a beatifical life, yet I feared to find it where it was, and ſought after it, by flying from it. For I thought I ſhould be in too wretched a condition, if deprived of the embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of a woman; and I imagined not the medicines of thy mercy to cure this infirmity, becauſe I had not tryed them, and ſuppoſed continency an effect of our own abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, in which I found mine too weak.

                  <p>Moreover the Serpent alſo, by me, tempted and ſpake to <hi>Alipius,</hi> and by my tongue wove and ſpread moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing nets in his way, to entangle thoſe vertuous and right treading feet. For when as he much wondered at me (of whom he had no ſmall eſteem) that I ſhould ſtick, ſo faſt, in the bird-lime of that pleaſure, as that, ſo often as he ſpoke to me of this ſubject, I affirm'd I could not poſſibly paſſe my life in Celibacy, and defended my ſelf againſt his admiration with ſaying, that there was a vaſt difference between his tranſitory, ſtoln pleaſure, long ſince forgotten, and therefore eaſily contemned, and my well-experienced and accuſtomed delights; which being alſo by marriage once rendered honeſt, that then he could have no reaſon at all to blame my choice of ſuch a life. Upon this, I ſay, he alſo began to deſire a married condition, not overcome with the luſt,* of ſuch a pleaſure, out * of curioſity; for he ſaid, he longed much to know, what thoſe delights were, without which this my life, ſo pleaſant to him, ſeemed not a life, but a pain unto me. For that ſoul, free from ſuch yoak, became aſtoniſhed at my thraldome, and from this aſtoniſhment, proceeded to a deſire of trying it, from that deſire ready to advance to the experiment it ſelf, and from thence, perhaps,<note place="margin">Iſa. 28.15 Wiſd. 1.16.</note> to fall into that thraldome he ſo much wondered at, becauſe he was ſo bold to make a Treaty and Covenant with Death; and becauſe, he that loveth danger, ſhall fall into it. For neither of us, if there be any conjugal honour, in the office of ruling a family, and of educating children, were moved with that, unleſſe very ſlightly. But it was the cuſtom of ſatisfying unſatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble luſt, that, for the greateſt part, and with the moſt vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency, agitated me already enſlaved; and it was the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration at me, that led-on him to become enſlaved.

                  <p>BUt although I thus granted thee uncontaminable and unalterable, or liable to miſery in any part, or member of thee, from the (Manichean-feigned) oppoſition of (I know not what) <hi>Gens tenebrarum</hi> or adverſe malignant powers, ariſing out of another lump of matter, contrary to that which thou hadſt made: which could it any way have hurt thee, thou muſt then (the very name of which all abhorre) have been ſuppoſed both violable and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible; (as was well preſſed by <hi>Nebridius</hi> long ſince at <hi>Carthage,</hi> and had then much ſtartled us, that heard it.)

And I ſtrained hard to ſee and diſcern (what I had heard,) that our own free-will, was the cauſe, that we did evil; and thy righteous judgements, that we ſuffered it. But I was not yet able to behold this clearly; But as I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to raiſe up the eye of my ſoul above theſe deep waters, I preſently ſunk again, and, often endeavouring it, I ſunk down again, and again.</p>
                  <p>On the one ſide, this elevated and buoy'd me up toward thy light, that already I knew as well, my ſelf, to have a will, as to live.

Again: whatever I did unwillingly and with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret, I ſaw my ſelf to ſuffer rather ſuch evil, than to do it: and judged it to be not my fault, but puniſhment; which alſo I, apprehending thee as juſt, ſoon confeſſed, not to be unjuſtly inflicted.</p>

God, not only good, but, goodneſs it ſelf? from whom have I then, to will evilly, and to nill well; that ſo there might be that, for what I might be juſtly puniſhed? Who put this thing into me? who planted in me this root of bitterneſs, All of me being made by the moſt ſweet Creator? If the Devil the author of it, whence then the Devil? But if he alſo, by a perverſe will, of a good Angel became a Devil, whence came in him this evil will, by which he became ſuch, ſince he totally was made, by the beſt God, a good Angel? And by theſe thoughts was I plunged again, and ſuffocated, yet not ſo low as that infernal error, to believe; That thou rather didſt (forced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) ſuffer, than man do, evil.</p>

                  <p>ANd I ſought from whence Evil might come, and I ſought evilly; yet ſaw not this evil in my inquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And my ſpirit placed before it the whole Univerſe, both of viſibles; as the Earth, Sea, Air, Starrs, Plants, Animals, &amp;c. and of inviſibles; as the Firmament of Heaven, and all the Angels and ſpiritual Inhabitants there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. [ ]. After this, I conſidered thee my God, as eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way infinite and boundleſs, environing, and entirely pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating this maſſe, as a ſhoarleſs ſea would fill a ſponge of a great, but finite, magnitude, placed within it: ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived I the finite Creature filled with thee the infinite God: and I ſaid within my ſelf: Behold, God: and behold, all the things God hath created. O how good is he; and moſt perfectly and incomparably more excellent and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, than they! yet, being good, he created theſe good; and behold, how he (outwardly) encircleth and (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in) repleniſheth all his Creation. Where then is Evil? or, whence, or what way, hath it ſtoln in hither? what is the root, and what the ſeed of it? Or indeed is it at all? Why fear we then, and why avoid we, that which is not? Or, if we vainly fear, ſurely this fear it ſelf is an evil, by which our ſoul is needleſly pricked and tortured. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, either there is an evil which we fear; or this, that we ſhould ſo fear, is an evil. Whence is it then? becauſe
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:120082:64"/>
God made all theſe things: the good God, all things good: He, the greater, and the ſupreme good, made theſe, the leſſer; but yet both the creating and the created, all are good. From whence then is Evil? or out of what did God make theſe things? Was there ſome preexiſtent matter which was bad, and he formed and rectified this; but ſo, that he left ſomething in it not converted into good? But why this then? Was he impotent to change it all, that ſo no more evil ſhould remain in it, who yet is omnipotent? Laſtly: why would he make any thing at all of it, and not rather by the ſame omnipotence annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late it? [ ] and prepare another matter totally good, out of which he might produce all things? for he were not omnipotent, if he could not make any good, unleſs he were firſt furniſhed with ſome matter, which himſelf had not made.</p>
                  <p>Such things I agitated in my perplexed breaſt, loaded with corroding cares from fear of death. And not find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the truth, yet the faith concerning Chriſt, both our Lord, and our Saviour, retained in the Church Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, was irremovably fixed in my heart; in many things indeed yet unformed, and floating beſides the rule of ſound doctrine; But my mind did never forſake it; yea, daily more and more ſought to imbrace it.</p>

For it was thou, thou alone; (for who elſe recals us from the death of any errour, but the life never dying, and the wiſdom, illuminating our needy minds, needing no illumination it ſelf, by which the whole world is orderly adminiſtred, even to the wind-ſcattered leaves of trees.) It was thou, that procuredſt for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medying of my obſtinacy (<note n="†" place="margin">See l. 4. c. 3.</note> which oppoſed both <hi>Vendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cianus</hi> an acute old man and <hi>Nebridius,</hi> a youth of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent ſpirit; the one vehemently affirming; the other, ſomewhat doubtfully, yet often, repeating; That there was no Art at all of foreſeeing or divining things future: but that mens conjectures had many times a luckineſs in
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:120082:65"/>
them; and that, in their ſpeaking many things that ſhould, were ſpoken ſome things which did, after come to paſſe; not foreknown by thoſe who ſaid them, but happened on, by their not ſaying nothing). Thou procuredſt (I ſay) a friend of mine, a curious conſulter of Aſtrologers, though himſelf not much ſeen in it, who related to me ſomething from his father, which (though he made little reflection thereupon) ſerved very much for the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of the vain eſteem of that Science. This man therefore (by name <hi>Firminus</hi>) ingenuouſly educated, and well ſtudied in eloquence, conſulting me, as one very dear to him, what I collected from his Conſtellations (as he call'd them) concerning ſome important affair of his, to which his ſecular hopes aſpired; and I (who was now ſomewhat inclined to <hi>Nebridius</hi> his opinion) conjecturing, and divining thereupon, what my doubting mind met-with in the Art, but withall ſuperadding, that I was almoſt perſwaded, all thoſe things were ridiculous and vain; he proceeded to tell me, how his father was a moſt curious ſtudent of ſuch books, and had alſo a friend alike-affected; who, with emulating ſtudies, and comparing of their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, were ſo farre enflamed toward thoſe toyes, as that, when any mute Animals of their own brought forth young, they marked the moment of their birth, and ſet down the poſitions of the Heavens in them, from whence they might gather ſome experiments of this Art. And he ſaid, he had heard from his father, that when his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was great with child of the ſaid <hi>Firminus,</hi> a certain maid-ſervant of his friends happened to be big with child at the ſame time, not unremarked by her Maſter, (who obſerved with moſt exact diligence even the puppyings of his dogs); and that ſo it happened, that, they with moſt wary obſervation accounting, one the day, hour, minute, of his wifes, the other, of his maids, being brought to bed, both were delivered at the ſame inſtant, ſo that they were forced to ſet down the ſame calculation, to a minute, of the Nativity, one of his ſon, the other of his ſervant: For, as ſoon as the women fell in labour, they gave mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all notice, and had one ready to ſend to each other, ſo ſoon as the child was born, and thoſe ſent, met ſo juſtly in the mid-way, that neither of them was permitted to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve any poſition of the ſtarrs, or particle of time diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the other. And yet <hi>Firminus,</hi> as honourably deſcended, ran the more happy courſes of this world, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed in wealth, was advanced in dignities. But the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:120082:65"/>
ſervant, having the yoke of his condition no way eaſed, waited on a Maſter, as he told me, vvho very vvell knevv him.</p>
                  <p>Hearing therefore and believing theſe things from ſo cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditable an Author, all my former reluctance preſently melted: and firſt I endeavoured to reduce <hi>Firminus</hi> from this curioſity; ſaying; That, from the inſpection of his Conſtellations, to tell him the truth of what ſhould ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, I was in them to diſcern, that his parents were of better quality, his family noble of the City, where they lived, his extraction, and his education honourable, his ſtudies ingenuous. But, if afterward the ſervant out of theſe Conſtellations (for he had the ſame) conſulted me, to tell him the truth alſo, I muſt in them behold his fortune, a moſt abject family, a condition ſervile, and all other things, farr differing, and much contrary to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. Whence it would follow, that, on the ſame aſpects, I was to read contrary fortunes, if I foretold the truth; or, if I read the ſame fortune, muſt ſay what was falſe. And hence I gathered, that what is ſpoken true from conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of ſuch Conſtellations, is ſaid, not by Art, but by gueſſe; and what is ſpoken falſe, is not from any unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of Art, but from the errour of gueſſing.</p>
                  <p>From this entrance, upon a further conſideration of theſe things; leſt any, who lived by this trade, (whom I much deſired to confute and render ridiculous) ſhould reply, that <hi>Firminus</hi> to me, or his father at leaſt to him, had told an untruth, I reflected my thoughts on thoſe who are born twins, who ordinarily are excluded into the world ſo haſtily one after the other, that the ſmall interval of time, whatever operation they may pretend it to have in nature, yet cannot be collected by humane obſervation, nor expreſſed in the compoſition of any figure, out of which the Aſtrologer is to make his prognoſtication. His predictions therefore either cannot be true, if from peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the ſame figure he ſhould ſay the ſame things (for example, of <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> when as the ſame things happened not to them both): Or, if true, he muſt not ſay the ſame of them, whereas yet his inſpection was utterly the ſame. Therefore, not from Art, but chance, it is, that he ſpeaketh truth.

For corruption doth ſome hurt unto them; and if it diminiſh no good in them, it hurteth them not. Either therefore corruption hurts them not at all, (which cannot be ſaid); or things corrupted are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of ſome good (which is moſt certain) But if they are deprived of all good, they will no longer be at all. For if they be ſtill; then, when no further deprivable of good, nor capable of further corruption, ſomething better they muſt be, than before ſo corrupted; becauſe now they will ſubſiſt incorruptibly. And what more monſtrous and abſurd, than to ſay, that things become better by the loſſe of all in them that is good? Therefore, what is deprived of all good, abſolutely ceaſeth to be.

And with much conſolation we hear it, when we hear in thy word, how the over-joyed ſhepheard brought home on his own ſhoulders the ſtrayed ſheep: And how the loſt groat was

                  <p>ANd now I will declare and confeſs to thy name (O Lord my Helper and my Redeemer) how thy good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs freed me, <g ref="char:trine">△</g> from that bond of the deſire of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man which tied me very ſtraight, as likewiſe, <g ref="char:trine">△</g> from the hinderance and ſervitude of ſecular affairs. I performed my former wonted employments with a continually-growing anxiety, and ſighed daily after thee: I frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thy Church, as often as there was any vacancy from thoſe affairs, under the preſſure of which I then lived. There was <hi>Alipius</hi> with me, now, after the third Seſſions, having a vacation from his Law-employments, and expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to whom he might ſell his advice; as I alſo ſold elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and the faculty of pleading, ſo farr as Art may conferr it. As for <hi>Nebridius;</hi> he had condeſcended, to the importunity of our common friendſhip, to teach un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Verecundus</hi> a moſt intimate acquaintance to us all, a Citizen, and a Grammarian of <hi>Millain,</hi> who much wanted help, and earneſtly begged it from ſome one of our ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. It was no deſire of gain that drew <hi>Nebridius</hi> to this employment, who could have had much higher from his learning, but only a loving reſpect unto us, whoſe requeſt ſo ſweet and compliant a diſpoſition could not deny. And very prudently was it undertaken by him, who purpoſely ſhunned to be known to perſons, according to this world, great, that he might ſo avoid all inquietude of mind;
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:120082:77"/>
which he deſired to have free, and (as often as might be) vacant, for to meditate, or read, or hear, ſomething con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning wiſdom,</p>
                  <p>Now on a certain day; (when <hi>Nebridius</hi> was abſent, I remember not on what occaſion) there came to our houſe, to me and <hi>Alipius,</hi> one <hi>Pontitianus</hi> our Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man an African, who ſerved in honourable place in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours Court. I know not what his buſineſs was, but we ſat down to entertain ſome diſcourſe; and, by chance caſting his eye on a book that lay on a billyard-table which ſtood before us, he took it up, opened it, and found it to be the Epiſtles of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> much contrary to his expectation; for he imagined it ſome book belonging to that Profeſſion, which then ſpent moſt of my time. But then, ſmiling, and, after a glad and gratulatory manner, looking upon me, he expreſſed his wonder, that he thus found thoſe, and only thoſe, writings before me. For a Chriſtian he was, and a baptized Profeſſor of the Faith, and who often proſtrated himſelf before thee our God in the Church, with frequent and long-continued prayers. To whom when I had replyed, that now my greateſt ſtudy was of thoſe writings, he began ſome ſpeech of one <hi>Antonius</hi> an Egyptian Monk; whoſe name was very famous amongſt thy Servants, but to that hour unknown to us; which he perceiving, ſtaid longer on that diſcourſe; informing, and wondring at, our ignorance concerning ſo eminent a perſon.</p>
                  <p>And much were we aſtoniſhed, when we heard thoſe ſo ſtrongly-witneſſed wonders of thine in the true Faith and in the Catholick Church, to be done ſo lately, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in our own dayes. All of us wondred: we, that they were ſo great; and he, that they were ſo unknown to us. Thence, he enlarged his diſcourſe concerning, * the multitudes of Religious in Monaſteries there, * their holy cuſtomes and manner of their life of a ſweet-ſmelling ſavour unto thee, and * the fruitful breaſts of thoſe barren deſerts; of all which we had heard nothing. And there was alſo a Monaſtery at <hi>Millain</hi> without the City-walls full of Good Friers under the maintenance and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Ambroſe;</hi> and we were ignorant of it alſo.</p>
                  <p>And he, continuing his diſcourſe, and we attentively ſilent, further told us: That, when the Court was at <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> one afternoon, when the Emperour was entertained with ſome publick ſports in the <hi>Circus,</hi> he and three others of his companions went a walking into ſome Gardens not
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:120082:78"/>
farr from the City-walls, and there caſually walking two and two together, one with him went one way, and the other two another; and that thoſe other, as they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred up and down, light upon a little Houſe, where dwelt ſome Servants of thine,<note place="margin">Mat. 5.3.</note> 
                     <hi>poor in ſpirit, of whom is the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven;</hi> and that they found there a book, in which was written the life of this <hi>Antonius</hi> Which life one of them began to read, and then to admire, and then to be enflamed, and, even whilſt reading it, to meditate of, inſtantly taking up the ſame life, and of forſaking his ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſervice, to entertain thine. (He was one of thoſe whom they call <hi>Agentes in rebus,</hi> Agents in the Prince's affairs<note n="†" place="margin">Their office, to gather the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours Tributes, apprehend Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents, make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions for the Court, &amp;c.</note>). Then ſuddenly, filled with a holy zeal, and a ſober ſhame, and anger at himſelf, he caſt his eyes upon his friend, and ſaid to him: Tell me, I pray, with all theſe our labours and pains, what doth our ambition reach at? what ſeek we? what is it we ſerve for in this our employment: Can we have any greater hopes in the Court, than to arrive to be Favorites to the Emperour? and in being ſo, what is there in that condition not brittle, and full of perils? and through how many dangers aſcend we to this much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter danger? and how long will it laſt? and how long ere we attain to it? But the Friend and Favourite of God I am, if I pleaſe, now preſently, and ſo for ever.</p>
                  <p>Thus he ſaid; and, labouring in the birth-throws of a new life, caſt his eyes again upon the paper, and read, and became changed within, where thou ſaweſt; and his mind emptied and ſtripped of the World; as ſoon appeared: for whilſt he reads, and ſuffers a tempeſt in his fluctuating breaſt, and now and then caſts out ſome ſighs, and groans, at laſt he concluded, and reſolved, upon thoſe better things: and, now wholly thine, ſaid to his Friend: I have now bidden a finall adieu to that our former hope, and am fully purpoſed for the ſervice of God: And this, from this hour, in this place, I will begin to put in practiſe. But you, if you do not like to imitate this my retreat, do not oppoſe it. Then anſwered the other: that he would alwayes adhere to the companion of ſo noble a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, and ſo high a reward. And thus, now both thine, having firſt caſt up the charges, they built that Tower of * their leaving all that they had,<note place="margin">Luk. 14.28.</note> and following thee.</p>
                  <p>By this time <hi>Pontitianus,</hi> and the other that walked with him, through another quarter of the Garden, were arrived at the ſame place, and, having found them, minded
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:120082:78"/>
them of returning homeward, becauſe it grew late. But they acquainting them with, their holy purpoſe, and the manner, how ſuch inclination was raiſed and confirmed in them, requeſted, that, if they pleaſed not to joyn with them in the ſame reſolution, they would give no diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance to it. Hereupon, they being nothing altered from their former ſelves, yet lamented (as he ſaid) their own worldly condition, and congratulated the others piety, and recommended themſelves to their prayers, and ſo, with a heart pointing downward toward the earth, returned into the Palace, and the other with a heart erected to heaven, continued in that little habitation. And both of them had their Spouſes, to whom they were contracted, who ſo ſoon as they heard of it, in imitation of them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated likewiſe their virginity unto thee.

                  </argument>
                  <p>BUt thou, O Lord, amidſt his diſcourſe, didſt turn me about towards my ſelf; and tookeſt me from behind my back, where I had placed me, whilſt I had no mind to obſerve my ſelf; and ſetteſt me before my face, that I might ſee how crooked, how ugly, and deformed a thing I was, covered over with ſcabs and ulcers; and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held and abhorred, and no way there was to fly or run away from my ſelf; and if I endeavoured to turn away my ſight from ſo loathed a ſpectacle, ſtill as he proceeded in his ſtory, thou didſt again bring me before my ſelf, and thruſt me before my eyes, that ſo I might diſcover mine iniquity and hate it. Not that I had not known it before; but I diſſembled it, and conniv'd at it, and forgot it. And now the more ardently I loved theſe perſons, who ſo pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and abſolutely reſign'd themſelves into thy hands, to receive their total cure from thee, the more deteſtably hated I my ſelf, when compared with them. Becauſe a many years were now run out with me (about ſome twelve years) ſince (in the nineteenth year of my age) the reading of <hi>Cicero</hi>'s <hi>Hortenſius</hi> had excited me to the ſtudy of wiſdom; and I had thus long deferred, by the contempt of earthly felicities, to ſet my ſelf at liberty for the ſearch of it; whereof not the finding, but the very ſearch, was farr to be preferred before all the found treaſures and Crownes of the World, and before
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:120082:79"/>
all the freely-flowing pleaſures of the body.</p>
                  <p>But I, then a wretched, very wretched, young man, had alſo, in the firſt dawning of that my youth, begg'd of thee chaſtity: and had ſaid: <q>[Give me chaſtity and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency, but, yet a while, do not give me it.]</q> For I feared that thou ſhouldeſt hear me too ſoon, and ſhouldſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently heal me of that diſeaſe of concupiſcence, which, I wiſhed rather, might be ſatiated, than extinguiſhed. And I had taken very wicked courſes in a ſacrilegious ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not as fully aſſured in it, but yet as preferring it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſome other things taught in thy Church, which were not by me reverently examined, but prejudicately oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, And I had alſo with pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ences coſened my ſelf, that therefore I deferred the contemning and renouncing of ſecular hopes, to follow thee alone, becauſe as yet there appeared not to me any certain truth to which I might ſteer my courſe. And now was the day come, in which I was laid naked to my ſelf; and my conſcience began thus to reproach me. Where art thou, Tongue? thou, that only profeſſedſt this, that thou wouldſt not lay aſide thy pack of vanity, for truth, or happineſs, whilſt yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain: Lo, now, certain it is and aſſured unto thee; and yet thy burden ſtill preſſeth thee; whilſt thoſe, with lightened ſhoulders, take wings, and ſoar upwards, who have not tired themſelves, (as thou), in the ſearch of it, nor, for ten years and more, meditated ſuch things.</p>
                  <p>Thus was I inwardly corroded, and extremely confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with an horrible ſhame, all the while <hi>Pontitianus</hi> was telling theſe ſtories. And ſo, his talk being ended, and the buſineſs for which he came, away he went. And I, being returned to my ſelf, what did not I now ſay againſt my ſelf? with what ſpurring and laſhing words did not I whip forward my ſoul, that it might readily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me ſtriving to go after thee? and it ſtill hung back and refuſed; and refuſed now, without excuſe. All its argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and reaſons were ſpent and confuted. Only there remained a mute and ſpeechleſs cowardiſe and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling; whilſt it feared, like death, to be bound from that flux of former cuſtom which waſted it unto the death.</p>

                  <p>AMidſt this great controverſie within, which I hotly diſputed with my ſoul in the cloſet of my heart, troubled as well in countenance, as in mind, I turn to <hi>Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius,</hi> and exclaim: <q>[What is this we ſuffer? what is it, you have heard? The unlearn'd ſtart up, and take heaven by force, whilſt we with all our Science, cowardly, and heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, (ſee) how we wallow ſtill in fleſh and blood. What? becauſe they have out-ſtript, and are gone before, us, are we aſhamed to follow? and are we not more aſhamed at leaſt not ſo much as to follow them?]</q> Some ſuch thing ſaid; and ſtraight my rage flung away from him; who ſtood ſilent, and beheld me with much amazement. For neither did I ſpeak language uſual; and beſides, my eyes, forehead, cheeks, colour, the accent of my voice, more ſpoke my paſſion, than my words did.</p>
                  <p>There was a little garden belonging to our lodging, which we had uſe of (as of the whole houſe) our hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table friend, the Maſter thereof, dwelling elſewhere. Thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this tumult in my breaſt carried me away, where none might hinder the hot contention which I had engaged with my ſelf, until it concluded in that iſſue, which thou already kneweſt, but not yet I. Only I was, in a ſober rage, and ſuffering a death that would beget life: well knowing, what evil I then was; not knowing what good, within a little while, I was to be. Thus away I went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the garden, and <hi>Alipius</hi> followed cloſe after me: for I counted my privacy not the leſſe for his preſence; nor indeed would he forſake me, whom he ſaw in ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order.</p>
                  <p>We ſate us down as remote as might be from the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. I fretred in my ſpirit, and raged with moſt implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble indignation, that I did not goe into a ſtrict league and covenant with thee (O my God,) whilſt all my bones cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, that I ſhould enter into it, and extolled it to the heavens unto me. And thither I needed not go, either in Ships, or in Coaches, or on my feet: no, not ſo farr as I went from the houſe to this ſeat in the garden. For not only to go, but to come to the end of ſuch a journey, was nothing elſe, but only to conſent and to be willing to goe; that is, to be reſolutely and entirely willing; and not to
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:120082:80"/>
turn and toſſe a will, maimed one half of it, ſometimes on one ſide, and ſometimes on another, in one part raiſing it ſelf up, and ſtrugling with another part that hangs down: And yet how many things (in theſe conflicts of my lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring will) did I effect, as I pleaſed, in my body, (which yet thoſe who would, alwayes cannot, do; as if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance they have not ſuch members, or the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For example: if then I tare off my hair; or ſmote my forehead; or claſped my hands about my knee, as ſoon as I pleaſed, preſently I did it. Yet was it poſſible, in all theſe, to have willed them, and not have done them; if the unpliantneſs of my joynts could not ſerve my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. So many things therefore did I then, where to will them only, was not to do them: and yet did I not that, which incomparably more contented me; and which, as ſoon as I would. I might, do, becauſe as ſoon as I would I might will it; for here the ability was the ſame that the will; and to will only, was to do, it: and yet it was not done; and the body yielded a more eaſie obedience to the ſmalleſt willing of the ſoul, to bend its limbs accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the others beck, than the ſoul it ſelf did to it ſelf, and that for its greateſt joy and pleaſure; and this to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected and accompliſhed only by willing it.</p>

The mind commands the body, and is preſently obeyed; the mind commands it ſelf, and is oppoſed; the mind commands the motion of the hand, and ſo ſpeedily is it executed, as the obedience is ſcarce diſtinguiſhable from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; and yet the mind is a ſpirit, and the hand a body: the ſame mind commands the mind to will a thing, the very ſame eſſence with it, and yet it doth it not. Whence ſuch a monſter? and how can this be? It commands (I ſay)
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:120082:80"/>
that it ſhould will a thing, which could not command it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it willed it, firſt; and yet that is not done, which it commands.</p>
                  <p>Indeed it is not wholly willing, therefore neither doth it wholly command; for only ſo farr it commands, as it wills: and ſo farr what it commands is not done, as it wills not, that it ſhould be done. Becauſe the will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, that there ſhould be a willing, and nothing elſe commands this, but only it ſelf upon it ſelf, therefore it doth not wholly command it: and therefore that which it commands that it may be, is ſuch a thing, as is not alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; for if the will were already wholly inclined to ſuch a thing, it would not command, that ſuch inclination ſhould be, becauſe it was already. Both to will, and yet to nill in part, therefore, is no monſter; But a ſickneſs and infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the mind, which cannot entirely ariſe, when lifted up by the truth, becauſe 'tis counterpoiſed by vitious cuſtom. And, therefore only, there are two willings, becauſe one of them is not total; and ſo what is wanting to the one, makes up and fortifieth the other.</p>

                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>me I, who as yet neither fully willed, nor fully nilled it; and therefore, was in contention with my ſelf, and divided and rent from my ſelf; and this rent in me indeed was made againſt my will; yet it ſignified not in me, the inhabitancy of ſome forreign mind, but the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my own: and therefore it was no more I, that wrought this diſtraction, but ſin that dwelled in me, from the puniſhment of that firſt more freely-committed of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; inaſmuch as I am a ſon of <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And, certainly, if there were ſo many contrary natures in us, as there are in us contrary deſires, there will not be two principles only: one of our good inclinations, the other of our bad; But muſt be many alſo of the bad, and many of the good. Since we have many wills and deſires oppoſing and hindering one another, and yet all of them
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:120082:81"/>
bad; and many repugning alſo, one to another, yet all which are good; the acting of all which may concurr up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame point of time, and all may be equally affected, but cannot be all at once effected. [ ] Which, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſtruggle amongſt themſelves until ſome one thing be choſen, to which may be totally carried that one will, which before was divided towards many. So when Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity delights us above, and the pleaſure of a temporal good re-tempts us here below, it is the ſame ſoul, not with a full will, willing the one, or the other; and therefore it remains ſuſpended with a tormenting diſtraction, whilſt from the Truth it preferrs one, and from its acquaintance cannot quit the other.</p>

                  <p>THus ſick of mind, and thus tormented I was, accuſing my ſelf much more ſeverely than formerly, and tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, and winding to and fro in my chain, till I had wholly broken it off; a ſmall piece only of which now held me, yet held me ſtill. And thou, O Lord, preſſedſt ſore upon me in my inner parts, with a ſevere mercy; redoubling the laſhes of fear and ſhame, * that I might not give over ſtretching, and * leſt I ſhould not break off that thin piece which only remained, and it ſhould grow again upon me, and bind me faſter, than ever.</p>
                  <p>For now I ſaid within to my ſelf; <q>[Come, let it be done preſently, juſt now let it be done:]</q> and already in word I began a league with thee: and already I almoſt did it: but quite did it not. Neither relapſed I again into for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer wonts, but ſtood and took breath, being very near it, and then ſet on again, and was arrived almoſt at it; and almoſt, now, and now, touched, and laid hold on it; and yet I was not quite there, nor, yet, touched, nor held, it; demurring a while, to die unto death, and to live unto life; and the worſe, long uſed, being farr more prevalent in me, than the better, untried: And the point of time, in which I was to become another man, how much it approached nearer, ſtruck in me ſo much more hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. Yet did it not make me to reconcile, or quite turn away, but only to ſtand in a ſuſpenſe.</p>
                  <p>There hung ſtill upon me thoſe trifles of trifles, and vanities of vanities, my old Miſtreſſes; and plucking me by the veſture of the fleſh, ſoftly whiſpered unto me. <q>[Will you then thus forſake us? and, from this moment no

Let thy mercy ever avert <hi>the remembrance of</hi> them from the ſoul of thy Servant. What filthineſs, what infamies did they ſuggeſt? and I heard them (now, much more than half, none of theirs) not as boldly affronting me, or freely contradicting me to my face, but as lowly muttering behind me, and ſecretly pulling me (when going away), only to look once more back upon them. Yet they ſomewhat retarded me, that I made not due ſpeed to catch away my ſelf and ſhake them off, and to ſpring from them whither thy Grace cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led me, whilſt a ſtrong cuſtom of them ſaid unto me, <hi>Thinkeſt thou, that thou canſt, for ever henceforth, live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch things?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But now it ſaid this but very faintly. For there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared unto me on that part, where I had already turned my face, but whither I yet trembled to paſſe, Continency, with a maieſtick modeſty, ſerene, and un-diſſolutely cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; and honeſtly tempting me to come forward, and to fear nothing: and extending, towards the receiving and the embracing of me, thoſe charitable armes of hers, ſo full of ſocieties, of good examples. There were enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ſo many children, boys and girles, ſo much flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing youth, and all other ages, grave widdows, and aged virgins: And, in all theſe, Continency, not barren, but a fruitful mother of children, namely of celeſtial joyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten by thee, O Lord, her moſt dear Husband. And ſhe, with a perſwading deriſion, laughed at me, as if ſhe had ſaid; <hi>And art not thou able to do, what thoſe youths and thoſe maidens are? Or are thoſe and thoſe able in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? and not in the Lord their God? the Lord their God gave me unto them. Why ſtandeſt thou upon thy ſelf, and therefore doſt not ſtand? throw thy ſelf upon him, and fear nothing, he will not withdraw himſelf, to let thee fall: Caſt thy ſelf upon him ſecurely, for he will catch and will ſave thee.</hi> And I bluſhed exceedingly, that I yet continued to hear the former whiſperings of thoſe Toyes, and to hang in ſuſpenſe. And, again, ſhe ſeemed to ſay to me;<note place="margin">Col. 3.5.</note> 
                     <hi>Stop thine eares againſt thoſe thy unclean members which are on the earth, that they may be mortified. They tell thee of ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain delights, but not of ſuch as the Law of the Lord thy God

                     <p>His totall Converſion by reading (upon hearing a voice from Heaven) a paſſage of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> where the book firſt opened.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>BUt as ſoon as more profound meditation had drawn out, from the very bottom of this ſink, and laid on an heap, all my miſery before the view of my ſoul, there aroſe in me a mighty tempeſt, bringing with it great ſhowres of teares. Which that I might more freely pour forth with their proper words and expreſſions, I roſe from <hi>Alipius,</hi> conceiving ſolitude more ſuitable to a buſineſs of weeping, and removed ſo farr off, as where neither his preſence might be burdenſome unto me. Thus it was with me; and he perceiving ſomething (I know not what) from my words when I aroſe, in which the change of my voice ſhewed me big with tears, ſtayed ſtill where he ſate, much amazed.</p>
                  <p>I, under a certain fig-tree, threw down my ſelf I know not how, and gave liberty to my teares; and the rivers of my eyes ran apace, being an acceptable ſacrifice unto thee. And, not indeed in theſe words, but, to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, I ſaid many things unto thee. <hi>And thou, O Lord, how long?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 79.5.8.</note> 
                     <hi>how long wilt thou be angry, for ever? Remember not our former iniquities.</hi> For I well perceived I was ſtill poſſeſſed and withheld by them, and therefore call out ſuch miſerable complaints. <hi>How long; how long? to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and to morrow? Why not preſently, why not, this very hour, an end to my filthineſs?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe things I uttered, as I wept, with a moſt bitter contrition of ſpirit: And behold I heard a voice, as from a neighbouring houſe, as of a Boy or Girle, I know not whether, in a ſinging note: ſaying, and often repeating: <hi>Tolle, Lege; Tolle, Lege; Take up and read.</hi> And pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently my countenance being altered, I began with much intention to conſider, whether Children were wont, in any kind of play, to ſing any ſuch words: nor could I call to mind, that I had any where heard the like. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, ſuppreſſing the courſe of my teares, I roſe up, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting it to be nothing elſe but a divine Admonition,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:120082:82"/>
that I ſhould open the book; and read the place I firſt light upon. For I had heard of <hi>Antonius,</hi> * that entring by chance into a Church, when the Goſpel was reading, he took himſelf to be admoniſhed, as if that was particularly addreſſed to him, what was then read:<note place="margin">Mat. 19.21.</note> 
                     <hi>[Go and ſell that thou haſt and give to the poor, and thou ſhalt have treaſure in heaven, and come and follow me]:</hi> and * that by this Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle he was out of hand converted unto thee.</p>
                  <p>So getting up haſtily, I returned to the place where <hi>Alipius</hi> was ſitting, for there, when I aroſe, I had left the Apoſtles book: I catched it up, opened it, read, in ſilence, the piece of the Chapter, on which I firſt caſt mine eyes. <hi>Not in rioting and drunkenneſs;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 13.13,</note> 
                     <hi>not in chambering and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs; not in ſtrife and envying: but put ye on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and make not proviſion for the fleſh to fulfil the luſts thereof.</hi> I would read no further, nor was there need: For at the end of theſe lines, as it were with a new light of confidence and ſecurity ſtreaming into my ſoul, the darkneſs of all former doubting and heſitancy was diſpelled. Then putting my finger, or I know not what other mark, between, I ſhut the book, and now with a ſerene and untroubled countenance related all to <hi>Alipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</hi> Who alſo thus diſcovered, what ſhould be done like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in him, which I obſerved not. He requeſted to ſee, what I had read: I ſhewed him the place; then He look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing attentively further than I had read, who knew not what followed, there found theſe, the next words. <hi>Him that is weak in the faith receive ye.</hi> Which words he applied to himſelf, and ſo ſhewed them to me. But this very admonition ſufficiently confirmed him, and ſtreight, without any afflicting delayes, did he joyn himſelf to me in this good and holy reſolution, ſo pleaſing and agreeable to his former manners, in the vertuous inclinations of which he alwayes aforetime had far ſurpaſſed me.</p>
                  <p>Thence we go in to my Mother. We relate our reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to her; ſhe rejoyceth; we tell her all the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances thereof, ſhe exults and triumphs, and fell a bleſſing thee, who art able to do above that which we ask or think; becauſe ſhe ſaw ſo much more granted her by thee concerning me, than ever ſhe had petitioned thee for, with all thoſe her miſerable and lamentable groans. For in ſuch a full manner didſt thou convert me unto thee, that I ſought now no more after wife, nor after any other hope of this world, ſtanding now with her upon that rule of faith,<note n="†" place="margin">See 3. l. 11. c.</note> as thou hadſt in a viſion repreſented me unto

her ſo many yeares before.<note place="margin">Pſal. 30.11.</note> And thus thou turnedſt her mourning into gladneſs; into a gladneſs much more plentiful, than that ſhe had aſpired to, and much more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and chaſt, than that ſhe had promiſed her ſelf from her grand-children of my body.</p>

And now there remained but a few dayes to the vacation of the vintage; which I reſolved patiently to endure, that I might relinquiſh my School at an accuſtomed ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and, being now purchaſed by thee, might return no more to be thus expoſed to ſale.

not extinguiſh, it. Nevertheleſs, becauſe that, by reaſon of thy name, now ſo glorified through the world, ſuch our purpoſe and vow muſt needs find many commenders, it ſeem'd, * that it might appear to have ſome reliſh of vain-glory in me not to have patience till a vacation ſo near, but to deſert a Profeſsion ſo publick, and eyed by all, before it; and * that the mouths of all men reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on this my act, and how near a breaking-up ſchool I would yet prevent, might ſay many things, as if I affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to magnifie my ſelf and ſeem ſome great one; and yet what mattered it to me, that men ſhould divine and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute my intentions;<note place="margin">Rom. 14.16.</note> or that our good ſhould be thus evil-ſpoken of?</p>
                  <p>But, beſides the opportunity of the Vintage-vacation, ſo it was, that, in the heat of Summer, my lungs began, * to fail, under the too much toil of my School, difficultly * to fetch breath, and by the pains of my breaſt to ſignifie their hurt, and now * to refuſe any very loud or long ſpeaking; which thing, at the firſt, had much troubled me, becauſe it would force me, either they being incurable, upon neceſſity to give o're ſo burdenſome a profeſſion: or, if curable, yet to intermit it. But after that a reſolute will to attend only on thee, and to ſee, how that thou art the Lord, was raiſed and confirmed in me; thou knoweſt (O my God, my joy) that I had this alſo, no falſe, excuſe, to ſweeten the diſcontent of thoſe men, who, for their childrens benefit envied my liberty.</p>
                  <p>Full of ſuch joy, I patiently therefore endured that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval of time, till it ſhould be run out. I know not, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were about ſome twenty dayes, but they were endured not without ſome patience, for I was already rid of thoſe ambitions, which formerly helped me to bear that heavy burden, with which now, therefore, I ſhould have been overlaid, had not patience took their place. Some of thy Servants, my brethren, may blame me for this, that, having a heart now fully reſign'd to thy ſervice, I ſhould any longer, (though but for an hour), ſit down in the chair of lies.

                     <pb n="161" facs="tcp:120082:89"/>And, for this her good education, ſhe was wont to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll not ſo much the care of her mother, as of a certain decrepit maid-ſervant, one that had carried her Father, when an infant, on her back, as bigger girles uſe to carry little children. For which reaſon, as likewiſe for her great age, and vertuous qualities, ſhe received, in this Chriſtian family, much reſpect from the Governours thereof. Therefore was the charge over her Maſters daughters committed to her, and as carefully diſcharged by her; one, of a ſober prudence in directing them, and of an holy ſeverity (when need was,) in reſtraining them. For, excepting the ſet houres of a ſlender repaſt, which they took at their parents table, ſh permitted them not, though never ſo dry and thirſty, to drink ſo much as a little water; preventing an evil cuſtome, and adding a good advice. <hi>Ye drink water now, becauſe wine is not in your power; but when ye come to get husbands, and are made mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes of cloſets and cellars; Water will grow contemptible to you, but the cuſtom of drinking will ſtick by you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>With ſuch prudence of inſtructing, and authority of commanding, ſhe eaſily ſuppreſſed the luſtings of that yet tender age, and moulded their very thirſt into ſuch a regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar habit; that it was no more affected by them, what was not meet for them; and what was not decent, now was not grateful.</p>
                  <p>Yet notwithſtanding this, there afterward ſtole upon her (as this thy hand-maid told me her ſon) by litle and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle there ſtole upon her, an affection to wine. For ſhe, as a ſober Maid, being uſually ſent by her parents into the Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to fetch wine, in taking it with a little ſcale out of the veſſel, before ſhe poured it into the flagon, uſed to put her lips to it, and ſip but a very little, for ſhe could do no more by the reluctance of her palat. For this was not, then at firſt done by her, out of any luſt to wine, but out of the over-flowing exceſſes of that age, which boyl up to many wanton tricks and experiments, where they are not allayed in youth, by the preſence and gravity of the aged. Therefore to this little ſhe by adding daily more littles <hi>(for whoever contemneth ſmall things,</hi>

For another maid-ſervant that uſually went with her to the cellar, on a time quarrelling with her young Miſtreſs (as it often happens) when they two were alone, objected this thing to her; with a moſt bitter inſulting, calling her <hi>Wine-bibber.</hi> With which reproach ſhe being notably ſtung, reflected on the foulneſs of her fault, condemned, forſook, it.

ſo patiently endured them, as that ſhe never had any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie with her Huſband about ſuch matter. For ſhe ſtill expected the deſcent of thy mercy upon him, that, being once made thy Convert, he would alſo become continent.</p>
                  <p>Beſides this; he was, as very amorous in his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, ſo very hot and haſty in his anger. But well ſhe knew to make no reſiſtance to him when in his paſſion; not only in deed, but neither in word. Only when he was re-calm'd and quiet, upon an opportunity offered, ſhe gave him an account of her action, if haply he had been without reaſon incenſed. And, when as there were ſome other principal Dames who, though matched to much gentler Husbands, than hers, yet carried about ſometimes upon their very disfigured faces the marks of their Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands fury; and they, (in their familiar diſcourſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) would ordinarily blame the naughtineſs of their Husbands, ſhe blamed that of their own tongues; as it were in jeſt, ſoberly remembring them, * that, from the time they had firſt heard their matrimonial Contracts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, they were to account them as Indentures, whereby they were made ſervants; and ſo, mindful of ſuch their condition, * that they ought not to grow haughty againſt their Maſters. And when they, knowing what a choleri k Huſband ſhe endured, wondred, that it was never heard, or any other way appeared, that <hi>Patricius</hi> had beaten his Wife, or that any other domeſtical diſſenſions, even for one day, had happened between them; and familiarly enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the reaſon thereof; ſhe acquainted them with her rule and practiſe ſet down above. And thoſe amongſt them, who obſerved the ſame, upon their own experience re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned many thanks; thoſe who obſerved it not, kept ſtill in ſlavery, ſuffered much miſery.</p>
                  <p>Her Mother in law alſo, by the tales and whiſpers of malicious and naughty maid-ſervants, becoming at their firſt living together much incenſed againſt her, ſhe ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came her by her obſervance, and her perſeverance in all long-ſuffering and meekneſs, that of her own accord ſhe diſcloſed to her Son whoſe intermedling tongues they were, whereby the peace of the houſe between her and her daughter-in-law had been ſo diſturbed; and deſired, he would puniſh them. And thus after he, both in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his Mother, and care of the diſcipline of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, &amp; of the amity of the members thereof, had correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe complained-of, as ſhe deſired, and ſhe alſo had promiſed the like reward to whoever ſhould hereafter, as
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:120082:91"/>
to pleaſe her, ſpeak evill of her daughter in law, none thenceforward daring to do it; Very memorable was the ſweetneſſe of that perfect amity they ever after enjoyed.</p>
                  <p>Thou hadſt alſo conferred this excellent gift on that thy good Servant, in whoſe womb thou waſt pleaſed to forme me (O my God, my Mercy) that between diſ-a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing and diſſenting parties (in all things ſhe could) ſhe rendred herſelf ſuch a peacemaker, that when hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mutually from both of them many bitter reproachings of one another (ſuch as a ſwelling and undigeſted choler uſeth to belch up, when the crudities of hatred are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haled, and breathed forth in a ſoure diſcourſe to ſom one preſent, whom they affect, concerning another ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, whom they diſreliſh) yet ſhe never diſcloſed any thing of the one to the other, but only what tended to their reconcilement.</p>
                  <p>A ſmall vertue in her would this have ſeemed to me, but that by ſad experience I find innumerable multitudes (I know not from what horrid contagion of ſin) very zealous, not only * to diſcloſe to enemies when in anger, what is ſaid by their enemies, in their ang r: but alſo, themſelves * to ſuperadd things which were not ſaid by ſuch enemies Whereas, for a mind endued with any humanity it is too ſmall a kindneſſe not to divulge, and exagitate others quarrellings and reproaches, or not to augment them alſo with their own ſpeaking evill, unleſſe they do endeavour likewiſe, by their own well-ſpeaking, to abate and extinguiſh them.

and with an offended countenance checking him with her eyes, that he ſhould yet reliſh ſuch things, then look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on me ſhe ſaid, hear you what he ſaith? and then, to us both: <hi>Lay this body any where; let the care thereof no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing trouble you.

                  <p>And I fell into a deep meditation on thy gifts (O my God ſo inviſible) which thou ſoweſt in the hearts of thy faithfull, and which bring forth ſuch admirable fruits: and much, rejoyced, and gave thanks unto thee, calling to mind, what I knew formerly, with what great care ſhe had alwaies been perplexed concerning her place of buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, which ſhe had provided and prepared for her ſelf near the body of her huſband<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For, becauſe they had ever lived very peaceably together, ſhe deſired alſo (as hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane affections are leſſe capable of Divine matters) that this might be accumulated to their former felicity, and might be commemorated by poſterity, that it was gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her, after her croſſing the ſea, and ſo long forreign travells, to have the ſame tomb and earth to cover the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited aſhes of her and her huſband.</p>

And I heard afterward that at <hi>Oſtia,</hi> in my abſence, my mother had with much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence diſcourſed with ſome friends of mine, concerning, the contempt of this life, and benefit of death.

                  </argument>
                  <p>I Cloſed her eyes; and great grief preſently ſeized my heart, and thence overflowed into tears: but at the ſame time I forced my eyes, by the overruling power of my ſoul to drink up again this their fountain even unto dryneſſe, whilſt this inward combat was no ſmall pain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me. When alſo, at her laſt breath, my boy <hi>Adeodat</hi> burſt out on crying, we all chiding him for it, he forbare, (in the ſame manner, as alſo omething childiſh in me tended to weeping, but, checked by a more manly voice of my heart was ſtilled again) For we did not think it decent to celebrate that funeral with lamentations and complaints; becauſe theſe (for the moſt part) are uſed to deplore ſome miſery of the dead, or rather their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction. But neither miſerably did ſhe die, nor die at all: This was aſſured unto us both from the purity of her manners, from the ſincerity of her faith, and from other reaſons indubitable.</p>
                  <p>What was it therefore, that within, ſo much pained me, but a freſh wound given me from the cuſtom of our converſation together (ſo ſweet and ſo dear to me) now ſuddenly broken off? I confeſſe I took ſome ſolace in that teſtimony of hers in her laſt ſickneſſe, when ſpeaking-fair my then-ſervices towards her, ſhe called me her <hi>Dutifull Son,</hi> and related, with much tenderneſſe of affection, that <hi>She never once heard fall from my lips, a harſh or contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melious ſpeech toward her.</hi> But alas (O my God who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt us both) what compariſon could there be between ſuch honour from me given to her, and her great ſervices done to me? And therefore now, left deſtitute of her ſo great a ſolace, my ſoul was deeply wounded, and that life rent aſunder, which was now made up all one of mine and hers.</p>
                  <p>The boy ſtilled from crying, <hi>Euodius</hi> took up a Pſalter and began to ſing the Pſalme.<note place="margin">Pſal. 101.</note>

the uſual manner took care of the corps and funerall, I, going aſide, in a place where moſt conveniently I might, diſcourſed to thoſe, who thought it not fit to leave me then alone, ſuch things as were ſutable to the occaſion; and with that balme of thy truth ſought to mitigate my grievous pain well known to thee, but hid from them; who diligently hearkned to what I ſaid, and thought me to be without ſenſe of ſorrow. Whilſt I O Lord, mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while in thy ears, where none of them could hear me, much chid the ſoftneſſe of my affection, and forced back the flux of my grief: and ſometimes it yielded to me for a little, and then again with great violence reflowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me; yet not ſo farr, as to the burſting out of tears or changing my countenance. But very ſenſible I was of this preſſure I ſuffered within. And then again, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this extreamly diſpleaſed me, that humane things ſhould have ſuch power upon me, which, according to the lot of our mutable condition, and the appointed method of their ſucceſſion, muſt needs fall out, with yet another ſorrow I lamented this my ſorrow; and ſo became afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a double grief.</p>
                  <p>When alſo the Body was carried to buriall, I went, I return'd, without tears; Neither in thoſe prayers we poured forth unto thee when the ſacrifice of our ranſom was offered unto thee for Her, the body being ſet down by the grave ſide, before the interrment thereof (as the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom there is) neither in thoſe prayers (I ſay) ſhed I any tears. But all the whole day was I notwithſtanding, in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, grievouſly ſad, and with a troubled ſpirit, begg'd of thee to heal my ſorrow; and thou wouldeſt not do it. I ſuppoſe to ſhew me, even by this one experiment, the ſtrong bond of any thing we are long accuſtomed to, even againſt all the force of a mind, which now was no more fed with any of theſe deceiving conſolations.</p>
                  <p>It then alſo ſeemed good unto me to go the Bath and waſh my ſelf; having heard that this name <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>After this I ſlept, and awaked, and found now my ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows not a little mitigated; and, as I was alone in bed I called to mind thoſe moſt true verſes of thy ſervant <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe,</hi>

But,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.11.</note> when they hear from thee concerning themſelves, they cannot ſay: the Lord lieth. For what is it, from thee to hear of themſelves, but to know themſelves?

                  <p>But yet, thou, intimate Phyſitian of my ſoul, ſhew me what fruit of this confeſsion, of my preſent condition, I am now going about For the confeſſions indeed (made heretofore) of my forepaſt ſins (which thou haſt remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and covered, that thou mighteſt make me happy in thee, changing this my ſoul by faith and by thy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) which read or heard, do excite the heart of thoſe who are ſuch like not to ſleep on in deſpair ſaying: I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not; but to awaken themſelves through a ſenſe, of the love of thy mercy, and of the ſweetneſs of thy grace (by which whoever is weak becomes ſtrong, ſo ſoon as firſt by it he is made conſcious to himſelf of his own weakneſſe) And again good men, who are not ſuch-like, are alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted to hear of the forepaſt ills of thoſe, who are now freed from them: <hi>are delighted:</hi> not becauſe ſuch evills were, but becauſe they have been only, and now are not.</p>
                  <p>But now what fruit may there be (O Lord my God, to whom my conſcience maketh confeſſion daily, much more ſecure in the hope of thy mercy, than in the confidence of its own innocency); What fruit, I pray thee, of this my confeſsion alſo before men in this my writing, what a one for the preſent I am, not what a one in time paſt I have been? For ſome fruit of that, I have diſcovered and related. But this alſo, what a one I am now at this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant of my writing theſe my confeſsions, many are deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to know, both of thoſe who have been acquainted, and who have not been acquainted, with me; of thoſe who have heard any thing from, or concerning, me, but yet their ear cannot be laid to my heart, where I am what ever I am, and therefore they deſire to hear my outward confeſsion, of what I am within, where neither their eye, nor ear, nor ſoul, can penetrate: And this they deſire, as ready to believe, where they cannot know; becauſe that charity, whereby themſelves are honeſt, perſwades them, alſo, that I am no deceiver in theſe things I ſpeak of my ſelf, and this charity in them, gives credit to me.</p>

My good things are thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands and thy gifts; my evil things are my faults, and thy judgements. In thoſe let them rejoyce; and let them mourn in theſe: and let ſuch Hymnes and Elegies aſcend up into thy ſight from the cenſers of the hearts of thoſe my brethren. And thou (O Lord), well-pleaſed with this Incenſe out of thoſe thy holy Temples, have mercy on me according to thy great mercy, and for thy names ſake, and, not forſaking what thou haſt begun, conſummate in me what is yet imperfect. This fruit then there is of the confeſſions not of my paſt but preſent condition, which moves me to confeſs the various things of it, not only * before thee, in a ſecret exultation with fear; and again in a ſecret mourning with hope; but alſo * in the eares of believing ſons of men, companions of my joy; co-partners of my mortality; my fellow-Citizens and my fellow-pilgrims; who happen to go before, or to come behind, or to pace along with me, in the road of this life.</p>

                  <p>ANd firſt, not with a doubting, but a certain, conſcience, I may confeſs, (O Lord) that I do love thee. Thou haſt wounded my heart with thy Word, and it is ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured upon thee. Yet alſo, beſides my heart, the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and the Earth, and all the things which are in them, on every ſide cry out unto me, that I ſhould love thee; neither ceaſe they to ſay the ſame to all, that they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main without excuſe.

                  <p>And what is it I love now, in loving thee? certainly not the beauty of bodies, nor the decent order of times; not the ſplendour of light, ſo gladſom to this corporal ſight; not the melody of all ſorts of ſong and muſick; not the fragant ſents of floures, oyles and ſpices; not delicious Manna ard honey; not fair limbs alluring to carnal embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. None of theſe things love I now, when I love my God: And yet I confeſs I love alſo a certain light, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lody, and fragrancy, and deliciouſneſs, and embraces, when I love my God; who is, the light, melody, fragrancy, grateful ſuſtenance, and amorous embracements, of my inward man; where to my raviſht ſoul ſhines, what is not terminable by place, and ſounds, what is not meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable by time; and ſmells, what is not diſſipable by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring; and taſts, what no edacity diminiſheth; and is embraced, what no ſatiety ſeparateth.

asked the fleeting air above: and its vaſt region, with all the gueſts thereof, replyed, <hi>Anaximenes</hi> is miſtaken: I am not God. I enquired of the heavens, the Sun, the Moon and the Starrs; neither are we (ſaid they) God, whom thou ſeekeſt.</p>
                  <p>Then I ſaid unto all theſe things encamping round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout my ſenſes, (the doors of my fleſh): Ye have ſaid unto me of my God, ye are not He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>At laſt I reflected my eye upon my ſelf and ſaid to my ſelf; And what art thou? And I anſwered; a Man. And in this compound, there preſented themſelves unto me, a body, and a ſoul: the one more exteriour, the other more retired. And which of theſe ſhould it rather be, where I ought to ſeek my God? Whom I had ſearched already through bodies, from the earth even to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſo farr as the raies of my eyes, (my ſpies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad), could make any diſcovery?

                     <q>ALL theſe things I retein in memory; and retein in memory the manner how I learnt them. And many falſe arguings againſt them have I heard, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein alſo in memory; which although falſe, yet is there no error in my remembring of thoſe errours. And my diſtinguiſhing between thoſe truths, and theſe falſities which are ſaid againſt them, this I alſo remember: and I remember alſo how often I have compared, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered them; and I repoſe in memory my preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of them, that I may hereafter remember it. Therefore I remember alſo, that I have remembred them; and if hereafter I ſhall call to mind, that I cannot remember them, 'tis by the ſame faculty of memory, I do it. The ſame Memory alſo conteins the paſſions of my ſoul; but not in the ſame manner as the ſoul hath them, when ſhe is affected with them, but after a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per way of its own, much different. For I both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member my former joy, not rejoycing; and call to mind forepaſt griefs, without ſorrowing. My former fears I reflect on without any fear; and am mindful of my former deſirings, without any deſire. Nay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, on the contrary, I remember now paſt ſadneſſes with joy, and with ſadneſs my now paſt joyes.</q>

                     <q>WHat, when I name oblivion, and know what I name, whence knew I it, unleſſe I remembred it? I mean not here the ſound of the word, but the thing it ſignifies; which thing had I forgotten, I could not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, what that ſound meant.

                  <p>THe pleaſures of the ear had more ſtrongly inſnared, and captiv'd me: but thou haſt diſſolved theſe bonds, and haſt ſet Me at Liberty. I confeſſe, I do now ſtill a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and acquieſſe in the melody of thoſe ſounds, which are animated with thy ſacred himnes, when theſe are ſung with a ſweet &amp; skilful voice; yet not ſo adhereing to them, but that I can diſingage my ſelf at pleaſure. Yet theſe airs, by reaſon of the divine matter which uſhers them in, and procures their admittance, do ſeek ſome reſpectful enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments alſo in My ſoul; and I find ſome difficulty to give them one, exactly ſutable.

<pb n="195" facs="tcp:120082:106"/>
of which they are much excited. But yet the delight of My fleſh, (to which we ought not to yield-over the ſoul to be effeminated) doth often deceive Me; whilſt my ſenſe doth not ſo wait upon reaſon, as patiently to follow it, for whoſe benefit only it is made uſe of, but, in ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its own contentment, ſtrives to run before, and to lead, it. Thus in theſe things I offend, yet do not then, but afterward, diſcover my fault.</p>
                  <p>And ſometimes again, immoderately aware of this falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, I err on the otherſide, in too much ſeverity (but this very ſeldom) ſo that, *I would have all the melody of thoſe ſweet Tunes, in which <hi>Davids</hi> Pralter is uſually ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Yet again, when I call to mind, thoſe tears, I ſhed in the ſinging of the Church-hymnes at the firſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of My converſion to the faith, and now alſo * my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much more moved, not with the ſinging, but the things ſung, when tuned with a clear voice and a moſt conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent note, I again acknowledg great benefit of ſuch inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</p>
                  <p>Thus I float between the peril of being pleaſed, and the experiment of being profited: and am rather inclined (yet not with an irrevocable judgment) to approve the cuſtom of ſinging in the Church; that, by the delight of the ear, a weaker ſoul may raiſe it ſelf into an affection of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Yet whenever ſo it happens, that the ſinging it ſelf more moves Me, than the Matter ſung, I confeſs I ſin penally; and then had I rather hear no ſinging at all. Behold the preſent condition I am in. Weep ye with Me, and for Me weep, ye who within your ſelves have the like good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes with Me (from which purpoſing flows well-doing) as for you, who have none, ſuch things as theſe trouble not you; and thou, O Lord, my God, look back upon Me, and hear, and ſee, and pity, and heal me; in whoſe ſight, I am thus become a queſtion, and a doubt unto My ſelf; &amp; this is My preſent Malady.</p>

                  <p>TO this firſt is joined a ſecond ſort of temptation more variouſly perillous. For beſides <hi>the luſt of the fleſh,</hi> which lyes in the delectation, *of all the ſenſes,<note place="margin">Pſal. 73.27.</note> and * of thoſe pleaſures, after which they go a whoring, who are farr from thee, there dwels in the ſoul a certain vain and curious deſire, not of delighting her ſelf in the fleſh, but of making vain experiments by the fleſh through the means of the ſame corporeall ſenſes, maſked under the name of learning and ſcience; which being ſeated in the appetite of knowing, and, amongſt the ſenſes, the eyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the principal inſtruments of knowledge, is in ſcripture-expreſſions called <hi>the luſt of the eyes.</hi> For though proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſeeing belongs only to the eyes, yet we apply this
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:120082:108"/>
word alſo to the other ſenſes, when we employ them in ſearching after knowledge. [ ] So we ſay not only; See how it ſhineth, but ſee, how it ſoundeth; how it ſmelleth, or taſteth, or how hard it is And therefore the general ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of all the ſenſes is called, <hi>the luſt of the eyes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now what is done by our ſenſes for pleaſure, and what for curioſity, is thus evidently diſcerned; in that their pleaſure ſeeks after obiects, beautiful, melodious, fragrant, ſweet to taſt, gentle and ſoft to touch: but their curioſity often tries the contraries, not for the ſufferance from things ſo offenſive, but for the luſt of experiencing and knowing them. For what pleaſure is there to behold, in ſome mangled corps, that which ſtrikes us only with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and trembling?

                  <p>From this diſeaſe of curioſity it is, that ſtrange and wonderful ſights are preſented to us in publick ſhews and theaters. Hence men proceed to ſearch the concealed things of nature which ſhe hath wrought not for us, and the knowledg of which no way profits us, nor is there other deſign in our ſearch, ſave only the knowing them. Hence come thoſe inſpections into arts Magical only for a culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſcience ſake: and hence, in true religion it ſelf, is God often tempted, when ſignes and miracles are begg'd of him, where, not our health, or our benefit, but only the experiment, is the end of our deſires.</p>
                  <p>In this ſo vaſt a wood full of ſnares and dangers behold O Lord how many I have already cut and ſhaken off from My ſoul, even as thou haſt enabled Me to do this (O God of My ſalvation).

And ſo for riches (which are coveted to this end, that we may by them ſerve ſome one of the foremention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed luſts, or alſo two, or all, of them,) if my mind cannot,<note place="margin">Namely thoſe <hi>1 Jo 2.16.</hi> luſt of the fleſh, luſt of the eyes, pride of life.</note> in the poſſeſſion of them, throughly diſcover, whether it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temns them, more fully to try it ſelf, it may diſmiſſe them.

                  <p>What ſhall I therefore confeſſe unto thee in this kind of temptation O Lord? What? But that I am pleaſed with the praiſe, but more with the truth than with it. For ſhould it be propoſed to Me, whether I had rather, being mad, or ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant in all things, be commended, or being wiſe and moſt confirmed in the truth, be decryed, by all, I eaſily ſee, what I would make choiſe of; but yet I wiſh ſomething further than this; <hi>viz.</hi> that no joy concerning any good of mine might be the leaſt increaſed in Me, from anothers appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of it. But I confeſs, ſuch joy is not only increaſed in me by their praiſe, but alſo diminiſhed in Me by their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement. And, when I am troubled at this My miſery, I preſently meet with an excuſe for it; whether a iuſt one thou knoweſt O Lord, for I do ſuſpect it. For becauſe that thou, * haſt commanded us not only continency, that is, from what things we are to withdraw our love; but alſo juſtice, that is, where we are to place it; and * willeſt, that not only thy ſelf, but alſo our neighbour be loved by us, <hi>I</hi> often ſeem to My ſelf * to be pleaſed with his proficiency or with the good hopes I have thereof, when I am delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the commendations of one underſtanding things a right; and again * to be grieved in his behalf, when I hear one blaming, what he is ignoraat of; or what is praiſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy. For indeed <hi>I</hi> find my ſelf afflicted alſo with my own praiſes, when either ſuch things are commended in Me, wherein I diſpleaſe my ſelf; or when ſmall or light good things in Me are more valued, than they ought: But yet; on the other ſide, how know I, whether I am not thus affected, for that I would not have another entertain an opinion concering me, or concerning any thing mine, different from My own; and this, not becauſe his good or benefit moves me thereto, but becauſe thoſe good things in me, which pleaſe me, pleaſe me much more, when they alſo pleaſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother? For in ſome ſort, it is not I that am commended, when my judgment alſo concerning my ſelf is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, as, when thoſe things in me are commended, which diſlike me, or thoſe things more commended which leſs like me. Am I not therefore, in this, ignorant of my ſelf? In thee, O Truth, I ſee and learn, that, not for my own ſake, but for my neighbours good, I ought to take content in

                  <p>BUt the true Mediatour, whom in thy ſecret mercy thou haſt manifeſted to the humble; (and haſt alſo ſent him amongſt them,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 2.5.</note> that they might by his example learn humility) that Mediatour of God and men, the man Chriſt Jeſus, between theſe mortal ſinners, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal righteous one, hath appeared, mortal together with men, righteous together with God; that, becauſe the wages of righteouſneſs is life and peace, he by his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, which was allied to God, might evacuate death, to
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:120082:112"/>
juſtified ſinners, which death he was pleaſed to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with men. And this true Mediatour was alſo made known to the Saints of old; that they, by the faith of his paſſion to come, as we by the faith of it paſt, might attain ſalvation. And it was, as he was man, that he was Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour; but as he was the Word, ſo he was no midling perſon; becauſe equall to God, and God with God, and,<note place="margin">Phil. 2.6. Joh. 1.1.</note> together with the Holy Spirit, one God.</p>
                  <p>How far haſt thou loved us (O thou good Father) who ſparedſt not thine only Son, but deliveredſt him up for us ungodly? How far haſt thou loved us? for whom he,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.52. Phil. 2.6, 8.</note> who thought it no robbery to be equal to thee, was made ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject even to death, even to the death of the croſs: only he, free amongſt the dead, having power to lay down his life,<note place="margin">John 10.18.</note> and power likewiſe to take it up again; becoming unto thee, for us, both a Victor and a Victim, and therefore a Victor, becauſe he had been a Victim; becoming unto thee, for us, both the Prieſt and the Sacrifice, and therefore the Prieſt, becauſe a Sacrifice; making us unto thee, of Servants, Sons, by being born thy Son, and becoming our Servant. And therefore do <hi>I</hi> juſtly repoſe ſtrong hope in him, that thou wilt heal all my diſeaſes, by him, who ſitteth at thy right hand, and intercedeth unto thee for us. Elſe ſhould I deſpair; for many and great are theſe my diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; many and great they are, but greater is the cure, which thou haſt provided. And well might we have imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thy <hi>Word</hi> to have been too remote from having any alliance with us, and ſo have deſpaired of our ſelves, had it not thus been made fleſh and dwelt amongſt us. Affrighted with theſe my ſins, and with the load of my miſery, I had once a thought and a deſign of retiring my ſelf into ſome deſert ſolitude; but thou didſt prohibit it unto me, and confirmedſt me, ſaying; <hi>That therefore Chriſt died for all,</hi>

                  <p>Behold, O Lord, I caſt all my care upon thee: let me live, and I will conſider the wonderful things of thy law.<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.18.</note> Thou knoweſt my ignorance, my infirmities; Teach me; Heal me: He, thy only One, in whom are hidden all the treaſures of wiſdom and knowledge, redeemed me with his own blood.
